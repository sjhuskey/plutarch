<p class="center f2">PLUTARCH’S LIVES.</p>
<hr class="short">
<h2>LIFE OF AGIS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="a1"></a> Many writers have very naturally conceived that the
myth of Ixion, who is fabled to have embraced a cloud
instead of Hera, and so to have begotten the centaurs, is
really typical of ambitious men; for, although they aim at
obtaining glory, and set before themselves a lofty ideal of
virtue, yet they never succeed in producing any very
distinct result, because all their actions are coloured by
various human passions and prejudices, just as the herdsmen
with their flocks say in Sophokles’s play:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“We needs must serve them, though their lords we be,</div>
<div class="line">And to their mute commands obedience pay.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>These verses really represent the state of those who,
in order to obtain the empty title of statesmen and
popular leaders, govern a country by following the
caprices and impulses of the people. Just as the men
stationed in the bows of a ship see what is coming before
the steersmen, but yet look up to them as their chiefs and
execute their orders; so they who govern with a view
solely to their own popularity, although they may be
called rulers, are, in truth, nothing more than slaves of
the people.</p>
<p>II.<a id="a2"></a> An absolutely perfect man would not even wish for
popularity, except so far as it enabled him to take part in
politics, and caused him to be trusted by the people; yet a
young and ambitious man must be excused if he feels
pride in the glory and reputation which he gains by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
brilliant exploits. For, as Theophrastus says, the virtue
which buds and sprouts in youthful minds is confirmed by
praise, and the high spirit thus formed leads it to attempt
greater things. On the other hand, an excessive love of
praise is dangerous in all cases, but, in statesmen, utterly
ruinous; for when it takes hold of men in the possession of
great power it drives them to commit acts of sheer madness,
because they forget that honourable conduct must
increase their popularity, and think that any measure
that increases their popularity must necessarily be a good
one. We ought to tell the people that they cannot have
the same man to lead them and to follow them, just as
Phokion is said to have replied to Antipater, when he
demanded some disgraceful service from him, “I cannot
be Antipater’s friend and his toady at the same time.”
One might also quote the fable of the serpent’s tail which
murmured against the head and desired sometimes to take
the lead, and not always follow the head, but which when
allowed to lead the way took the wrong path and caused
the head to be miserably crushed, because it allowed itself
to be guided by that which could neither see nor hear.
This has been the fate of many of those politicians who
court the favour of the people; for, after they have once
shared their blind impulses, they lose the power of checking
their folly, and of restoring good discipline and order.
These reflections upon the favour of the people occurred
to me when I thought of its power, as shown in the case
of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, men who were well born,
well educated, and began their political career with great
promise, and yet were ruined, not so much by an excessive
craving for popular applause as by a very pardonable fear
of disgrace. They both received at the outset great proofs
of their countrymen’s goodwill, but felt ashamed to remain
as it were in their debt, and they ever strove to wipe out
their obligations to the people by legislation on their behalf,
and by their beneficent measures continually increased
their popularity, until, in the heat of the rivalry thus
created, they found themselves pledged to a line of policy
in which they could not even pause with honour, and
which they could not desist from without disgrace. The
reader, however, will be able to form his own opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
about them from their history, and I shall now write, as a
parallel to them, the lives of that pair of Laconian reformers,
Agis and Kleomenes, kings of Sparta, who, like
the Gracchi, increased the power of the people, and
endeavoured to restore an admirable and just constitution
which had fallen into desuetude; but who, like them,
incurred the hatred of the governing class, who were unwilling
to relinquish their encroachments and privileges.
These Lacedæmonians were not indeed brothers, yet
they pursued a kindred policy, with the same objects in
view.</p>
<p>III.<a id="a3"></a> After the desire for silver and gold had penetrated
into Sparta, the acquisition of wealth produced greed and
meanness, while the use and enjoyment of riches was
followed by luxury, effeminacy, and extravagance. Thus
it fell out that Sparta lost her high and honoured position
in Greece, and remained in obscurity and disgrace until the
reign of Agis and Leonidas. Agis was of the Eurypontid
line, the son of Eudamidas, and the sixth in descent from
king Agesilaus, who invaded Asia, and became the most
powerful man in Greece. This Agesilaus had a son named
Archidamus, who fell in battle against the Messapians at
the battle of Mandurium<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">1</a> in Italy. He was succeeded by
his eldest son Agis, who, being killed by Antipater near
Megalopolis, and leaving no issue, was succeeded by his
brother, Eudamidas; he, by a son named Archidamus;
and Archidamus by another Eudamidas, the father of Agis,
the subject of this memoir.</p>
<p>Leonidas, the son of Kleonymus, was of the other royal
family, that of the Agiadæ, and was eighth in descent from
Pausanias who conquered Mardonius at the battle of
Plataea. Pausanias had a son named Pleistoanax, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
son was again named Pausanias. This Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">2</a> fled for
his life from Sparta to Tegea, and was succeeded by his
eldest son Agesipolis; and he, dying childless, by his
younger brother Kleombrotus. Kleombrotus left two sons,
Agesipolis and Kleomenes, of whom Agesipolis reigned
but a short time, and left no children. Kleomenes succeeded
his brother Agesipolis on the throne. Of his two
sons, the elder, Akrotatus, died during his father’s lifetime,
and the younger, Kleonymus, never reigned, as the throne
was occupied by Areus<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">3</a> the grandson of Kleomenes, and
the son of Akrotatus. Areus perished in battle before
Corinth, and was succeeded by his son Akrotatus. This
Akrotatus was defeated and slain near the city of Megalopolis
by the despot Aristodemus, leaving his wife pregnant.
When she bore a son, Leonidas the son of
Kleonymus was appointed his guardian, and, as the child
died before reaching manhood, he succeeded to the
throne although he was far from being an acceptable
personage to his countrymen; for, though the Spartans
at this period had all abandoned their original severe
simplicity of living, yet they found the manners of
Leonidas in offensive contrast to their own. Indeed,
Leonidas, who had spent much of his life at the courts
of Asiatic potentates, and had been especially attached
to that of Seleukus, seemed inclined to outrage the political
feeling of the Greeks by introducing the arrogant tone
of an Oriental despot into the constitutional monarchy
of Sparta.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="a4"></a> On the other hand, the goodness of heart and intellectual
power of Agis proved so greatly superior not
only to that of Leonidas, but of every king since Agesilaus
the Great, that before he arrived at his twentieth year,
in spite of his having been brought up in the greatest
luxury by his mother Agesistrata and his grandmother
Archidamia, the two richest women in Sparta, he abjured
all frivolous indulgence, laid aside all personal ornament,
avoided extravagance of every kind, prided himself on
practising the old Laconian habits of dress, food, and
bathing, and was wont to say that he would not care to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
be king unless he could use his position to restore the
ancient customs and discipline of his country.</p>
<p>V.<a id="a5"></a> The corruption of the Lacedæmonians began at
the time when, after having overthrown the Athenian
empire, they were able to satiate themselves with the
possession of gold and silver. Nevertheless, as the number
of houses instituted by Lykurgus was still maintained,
and each father still transmitted his estate to his son, the
original equal division of property continued to exist
and preserved the state from disorder. But a certain
powerful and self-willed man, named Epitadeus, who was
one of the Ephors, having quarrelled with his son, proposed
a rhetra permitting a man to give his house and
land to whomsoever he pleased, either during his life,
or by his will after his death. This man proposed the
law in order to gratify his own private grudge; but the
other Spartans through covetousness eagerly confirmed it,
and ruined the admirable constitution of Lykurgus.
They now began to acquire land without limit, as the
powerful men kept their relatives out of their rightful
inheritance; and as the wealth of the country soon got
into the hands of a few, the city became impoverished,
and the rich began to be viewed with dislike and hatred.
There were left at that time no more than seven
hundred Spartans, and of these about one hundred possessed
an inheritance in land, while the rest, without
money, and excluded from all the privileges of citizenship,
fought in a languid and spiritless fashion in the wars,
and were ever on the watch for some opportunity to subvert
the existing condition of affairs at home.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="a6"></a>. Agis, therefore, thinking that it would be an
honourable enterprise, as indeed it was, to restore these citizens
to the state and to re-establish equality for all, began
to sound the people themselves as to their opinion about
such a measure. The younger men quickly rallied round
him, and, with an enthusiasm which he had hardly counted
upon, began to make ready for the contest; but most of
the elder men, who had become more thoroughly tainted
by the prevailing corruption, feared to be brought back
to the discipline of Lykurgus as much as a runaway
slave fears to be brought back to his master, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
bitterly reviled Agis when he lamented over the condition
of affairs and sighed for the ancient glories of
Sparta. His enthusiastic aspirations, however, were
sympathised with by Lysander the son of Libys, Mandrokleidas
the son of Ekphanes, and Agesilaus. Lysander
was the most influential of all the Spartans, while
Mandrokleidas was thought to be the ablest politician in
Greece, as he could both plot with subtlety and execute
with boldness. Agesilaus was the uncle of King Agis and
a fluent speaker, but of a weak and covetous disposition.
It was commonly supposed that he was stirred to action
by the influence of his son Hippomedon, who had gained
great glory in the wars and was exceedingly popular
among the younger citizens; but what really determined
him to join the reformers was the amount of his debts,
which he hoped would be wiped out by a revolution.
As soon as Agis had won over this important adherent, he
began to try to bring over his mother to his views, who
was Agesilaus’s sister, and who, from the number of her
friends, debtors, and dependants, was very powerful in
the state, and took a large share in the management of
public affairs.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="a7"></a> When she first heard of Agis’s designs she was
much startled, and dissuaded the youth from an enterprise
which she thought neither practicable nor desirable.
However, when Agesilaus pointed out to her what a notable
design it was, and how greatly to the advantage of all,
while the young king himself besought his mother to
part with her wealth in order to gain him glory,
arguing that he could not vie with other kings in riches,
as the servants of Persian satraps, and the very slaves of
the intendants of Ptolemy and Seleukus possessed more
money than all the kings that ever reigned in Sparta;
but that, if he could prove himself superior to those
vanities by his temperance, simplicity of life, and true
greatness of mind, and could succeed in restoring equality
among his fellow-countrymen, he would be honoured and
renowned as a truly great king. By this means the
youth entirely changed his mother’s mind, and so fired
her with his own ambition, as if by an inspiration from
heaven, that she began to encourage Agis and urge him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
on, and invited her friends to join them, while she also
communicated their design to the other women, because
she knew that the Lacedæmonians were in all things
ruled by their women, and that they had more power
in the state than the men possessed in their private households.
Most of the wealth of Lacedæmon had fallen into
female hands at this time, and this fact proved a great hindrance
to the accomplishment of Agis’s schemes of reform;
for the women offered a vehement opposition to him, not
merely through a vulgar love for their idolised luxury, but
also because they saw that they would lose all the influence
and power which they derived from their wealth. They
betook themselves to Leonidas, and besought him, as being
the elder man, to restrain Agis, and check the development
of his designs. Leonidas was willing enough to assist
the richer class, but he feared the people, who were eager
for reform, and would not openly oppose Agis, although
he endeavoured secretly to ruin his scheme, and to prejudice
the Ephors against him, by imputing to him the design
of hiring the poor to make him despot with the plunder of
the rich, and insinuating that by his redistribution of lands
and remission of debts he meant to obtain more adherents
for himself instead of more citizens for Sparta.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="a8"></a> In spite of all this, Agis contrived to get Lysander
appointed one of the Ephors, and immediately brought
him to propose a rhetra before the Gerusia, or Senate, the
main points of which were that all debts should be cancelled;
that the land<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">4</a> should be divided, that between the valley
of Pellene and Mount Taygetus, Malea, and Sellasia into
four thousand five hundred lots, and the outlying
districts into fifteen thousand: that the latter district
should be distributed among the Periœki of military age,
and the former among the pure Spartans: that the number
of these should be made up by an extension of the
franchise to Periœki or even foreigners of free birth,
liberal education, and fitting personal qualifications: and
that these citizens should be divided into fifteen companies
some of four hundred, and some of two hundred, for the
public meals, and should conform in every respect to the
discipline of their forefathers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<p>IX.<a id="a9"></a> When, this rhetra was proposed, as the Senate
could not agree whether it should become law, Lysander
convoked a popular assembly and himself addressed the
people. Mandrokleidas and Agesilaus also besought them
not to allow a few selfish voluptuaries to destroy the
glorious name of Sparta, but to remember the ancient
oracles, warning them against the sin of covetousness,
which would prove the ruin of Sparta, and also of the
responses which they had recently received from the
oracle of Pasiphae. The temple and oracle of Pasiphae
at Thalamae was of peculiar sanctity. Pasiphae is said by
some writers to have been one of the daughters of Atlas,
and to have become the mother of Ammon by Zeus, while
others say that Kassandra the daughter of Priam died there,
and was called Pasiphae because her prophecies were plain
to all men. Phylarchus again tells us that Daphne the
daughter of Amyklas, while endeavouring to escape from
the violence of Apollo, was transformed into the laurel,<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">5</a>
which bears her name, and was honoured by the god and
endowed by him with the gift of prophecy. Be this as it
may, the oracular responses which were brought from
this shrine bade the Spartans all become equal according
as Lykurgus had originally ordained. After these speeches
had been delivered, King Agis himself came forward, and,
after a few introductory words, said that he was giving
the strongest possible pledges of his loyalty to the new
constitution; for he declared his intention of surrendering
to the state, before any one else, his own property,
consisting of a vast extent of land, both arable and
pasture, besides six thousand talents of money; and he
assured the people that his mother and her friends, the
richest people in Sparta, would do the same.</p>
<p>X.<a id="a10"></a> The people were astounded at the magnanimity of
the youth, and were filled with joy, thinking that at last,
after an interval of three hundred years, there had appeared
a king worthy of Sparta. Leonidas, on the other hand,
opposed him as vigorously as he could, reflecting that he
would be forced to follow his example, and divest himself
of all his property, and that Agis, not he, would get the
credit of the act. He therefore inquired of Agis whether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
he thought Lykurgus to have been a just and well-meaning
man. Receiving an affirmative reply, he again demanded,
“Where, then, do we find that Lykurgus approved of the
cancelling of debts, or of the admission of foreigners to
the franchise, seeing that he did not think that the state
could prosper without a periodical expulsion of foreigners?”
To this Agis answered, that it was not to be wondered at
if Leonidas, who had lived in a foreign country, and had
a family by the daughter of a Persian satrap, should be
ignorant that Lykurgus, together with coined money, had
banished borrowing and lending from Sparta, and that he
had no hatred for foreigners, but only for those whose
profession and mode of life made them unfit to associate
with his countrymen. These men Lykurgus expelled, not
from any hatred of their persons, but because he feared
that their manners and habits would infect the citizens
with a love of luxury, effeminacy, and avarice. Terpander,
Thales, and Pherekydes were all foreigners, but, since they
sang and taught what Lykurgus approved, they lived in
Sparta, and were treated with especial honour. “Do you,”
asked he, “praise Ekprepus, who when Ephor cut off with
a hatchet the two additional strings which Phrynis the
musician had added to the original seven strings of the lyre,
and those who cut the same strings off the harp of Timotheus,
and yet do you blame us when we are endeavouring
to get rid of luxury, extravagance, and frivolity, just as if
those great men did not merely mean thereby to guard
against vain refinements of music, which would lead to
the introduction of extravagant and licentious manners,
and cause the city to be at discord and variance with
itself?”</p>
<p>XI.<a id="a11"></a> After this the people espoused the cause of Agis,
while the rich begged Leonidas not to desert them, and
by their entreaties prevailed upon the senators, who had
the power of originating all laws, to throw out the rhetra
by a majority of only one vote. Lysander, who was still
one of the Ephors, now proceeded to attack Leonidas, by
means of a certain ancient law, which forbade any descendant
of Herakles to beget children by a foreign wife,
and which bade the Spartans put to death any citizen
who left his country to dwell in a foreign land. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
instructed his adherents to revive the memory of this law,
and threaten Leonidas with its penalties, while he himself
with the other Ephors watched for the sign from heaven.
This ceremony is conducted as follows:—Every ninth year
the Ephors choose a clear moonless night, and sit in silence
watching the heavens. If a star shoots across the sky,
they conclude that the kings must have committed some
act of impiety, and they suspend them from their office,
until they were absolved by a favourable oracle from
Delphi or Olympia. Lysander now declared that he had
beheld this sign, and impeached Leonidas, bringing forward
witnesses to prove that he had two children born to
him by an Asiatic wife, the daughter of one of the lieutenants
of Seleukus, and that having quarrelled with his
wife and become hated by her he had unexpectedly returned
home, and in default of a direct heir, had succeeded to the
throne. At the same time Lysander urged Kleombrotus,
the son-in-law of Leonidas, who was also of the royal
family, to claim the throne for himself. Leonidas, terrified
at this, took sanctuary in the temple of Athena of the
Brazen House, and was joined there by his daughter,
who left her husband Kleombrotus. When the trial
came on, Leonidas did not appear in court, he was removed
from the throne, and Kleombrotus was appointed
in his stead.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="a12"></a> At this crisis Lysander was forced to lay down his
office, as the year for which he had been elected had
expired. The Ephors at once took Leonidas under their
protection, restored him to the throne, and impeached
Lysander, and Mandrokleidas as the authors of illegal
measures in the cancelling of debts and the redistribution
of the land. As these men were now in danger of their
lives, they prevailed upon the two kings to act together
and overrule the decision of the Ephors; for this, they
declared, was the ancient rule of the constitution, that if
the kings were at variance, the Ephors were entitled to
support the one whom they judged to be in the right
against the other, but their function was merely to act as
arbitrators and judges between the kings when they disagreed,
and not to interfere with them when they were of
one mind. Both the kings agreed to act upon this advice,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
and came with their friends into the assembly, turned the
Ephors out of their chairs of office, and elected others in
their room, one of whom was Agesilaus. They now armed
many of the younger citizens, released the prisoners,
and terrified their opponents by threatening a general
massacre. No one, however, was killed by them; for
although Agesilaus desired to kill Leonidas, and when he
withdrew from Sparta to Tegea, sent men to waylay and
murder him on the road, Agis, hearing of his intention,
sent others on whom he could rely, who escorted Leonidas
safely as far as Tegea.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="a13"></a> Thus far all had gone well, and no one remained
to hinder the accomplishment of the reforms; but now
Agesilaus alone upset and ruined the whole of this noble
and truly Spartan scheme by his detestable vice of covetousness.
He possessed a large quantity of the best land
in the country, and also owed a great sum of money, and
as he desired neither to pay his debts nor to part with his
land, he persuaded Agis that it would be too revolutionary
a proceeding to carry both measures at once, and that, if
the moneyed class were first propitiated by the cancelling
of debts, they would afterwards be inclined to submit
quietly to the redistribution of lands. Lysander and the
rest were deceived by Agesilaus into consenting to this,
and they brought all the written securities for money
which had been given by debtors, which are called by
them <i>klaria</i>, into the market-place, collected them into one
heap, and burned them. As the flames rose up, the rich
and those who had lent money went away in great distress,
but Agesilaus, as if exulting at their misfortune, declared
that he had never seen a brighter blaze or a purer fire.
As the people at once demanded the division of the land,
and called upon the kings to distribute it among them,
Agesilaus put them off with various excuses, and managed
to spin out the time till Agis was sent out of the country
on military service, as the Achæans, who were allies, had
demanded a reinforcement from Sparta, because the Ætolians
threatened to invade Peloponnesus through the territory
of Megara, and Aratus, the general of the Achæans,
who was collecting an army to resist them, sent to Sparta
demanding assistance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>
<p>XIV.<a id="a14"></a> The Spartans at once despatched Agis at the head
of an army, whose high spirits and devotion to his person
filled him with delight. The men were nearly all young
and poor; and as they were now relieved from the pressure
of their debts, and expected that on their return the land
would be distributed amongst them, they behaved with
the most admirable discipline. They marched through
Peloponnesus without doing the least damage, without
offending any one, almost without noise; so that all the
cities were astonished at the spectacle thus afforded them,
and men began to wonder what a Lacedæmonian army
must have been like when led by Agesilaus or Lysander
the Great, or by the ancient hero Leonidas, if such awe
and reverence was paid by the soldiers to one who was
nearly the youngest of them all. Their youthful leader
himself was worthy of admiration, and was looked up to
by the men because of his simple hard-working habits,
and the pride which he took in wearing the same dress
and using the same arms as the common soldiers. The
revolution which he had effected, however, was very distasteful
to the rich, who feared lest it might be taken
as an example by the people in other states and lead to
further disturbances.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="a15"></a> Agis joined Aratus at Corinth, while the question
of how to repel the invasion was still being debated. His
advice was spirited, without being rash or foolhardy. He
gave it as his opinion that it was their duty to fight, and
not abandon the gate of Peloponnesus and let the enemy
into the country, but that he would defer to the decision
of Aratus, who was an older man than himself, and was
the general of the Achæans, and that he had not come to
give them advice or to take the command of them, but to
reinforce them and serve as their ally. The historian
Baton of Sinope declares that Agis declined to fight although
Aratus wished him to do so; but he is mistaken, and clearly
has not read the justification which Aratus has written of
his conduct, namely, that as the farmers had nearly all
finished gathering in their harvest, he thought it better
to allow the enemy to enter the country than to hazard
everything upon the issue of a single battle. As Aratus
decided not to fight, and dismissed his allies with thanks,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Agis returned home, greatly honoured by those under his
orders, and found the internal affairs of Sparta in great
turmoil and confusion.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="a16"></a> Agesilaus, who was now Ephor, and who was no
longer restrained by the presence of those of whom he had
formerly stood in awe, was using the most disgraceful
expedients to extort money from the people, and had even
intercalated a thirteenth month in the year, although the
state of the calendar did not require it, and caused taxes
to be paid for it. As he feared those whom he had wronged,
and was an object of universal hatred, he had taken a
body-guard of swordsmen into his pay, and walked through
the city accompanied by them. As for the kings, he regarded
Kleombrotus with contempt, and though he still
paid some respect to Agis, he wished it to be thought that
he did so because he was nearly related to himself, not
because he was king. He also gave out that he intended
to remain in office as Ephor for the next year as well.
In consequence of this his enemies determined to bring
matters to a crisis. They assembled in force, brought
back Leonidas publicly from Tegea, and reinstated him
as king, to the great joy of most of the citizens, who were
angry with the other party because they had been deceived
by them about the redistribution of the land. Agesilaus
was able to leave the country in safety, owing to the
intercession of his son Hippomedon, who was very popular
with all classes on account of his bravery. Of the two
kings, Agis fled to the temple of Athena of the Brazen
House, while Kleombrotus took sanctuary in the temple of
Poseidon.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">6</a> It appeared that Leonidas hated Kleombrotus
most of the two; for he passed by Agis, but marched in
pursuit of Kleombrotus with an armed force, and angrily
reproached him that being his own son-in-law he had
conspired against him, dethroned him, and driven him
into exile.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="a17"></a> Kleombrotus could find nothing to say in his
defence, and sat silent and helpless; but Chilonis, the
daughter of Leonidas, who formerly had taken offence at
her father’s injurious treatment, and when Kleombrotus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
usurped the throne had left him, and showed her sympathy
with Leonidas in his misfortune by accompanying
him in the temple where he took sanctuary, and after he
left the country by mourning for him and remaining at
variance with her husband Kleombrotus, now changed
sides with his changing fortunes, and appeared sitting by
her husband’s side as a suppliant to the god with him,
with her arms cast round him, and her two children on
each side of her. All stood amazed and were moved to
tears by her noble and affectionate conduct, and she,
pointing to her mean dress and dishevelled hair, said,
“Father, I have not adopted this posture and this dress
out of pity for Kleombrotus, but I have so long been in
mourning for your misfortunes and your banishment that
it has become customary with me. Am I now to remain
in mourning while you are victorious and reign in Sparta,
or am I to dress myself in fine clothes as becomes a princess,
while I see my husband murdered by your hand?
Unless he can move you to compassion, and obtain your
pity by the tears of his wife and children, he will suffer a
more terrible penalty for his misconduct than you wish to
impose, by seeing me his dearest wife die before him; for
how can I endure to live among other women, if I prove
unable to move either my husband or my father to compassion?
Both as a wife and as a daughter I have been
fated to suffer with my own kin and to be despised with
them. If there is anything which can be urged on behalf
of my husband’s conduct, I have made it impossible to
plead it for him by the part which I have taken in protesting
against his conduct to you; but you yourself suggest
a sufficient apology for his crime, by showing that
you think royalty so great and precious a thing, that to
obtain it you are willing to murder your son-in-law and
neglect your own child.”</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="a18"></a> Chilonis, after speaking thus, nestled her face
against that of her husband, and glanced round at the
spectators with red and tearful eyes. Leonidas, after a
short consultation with his friends, bade Kleombrotus rise
and leave the country, but besought his daughter to remain
with him, and not to leave him who loved her so dearly,
and had just spared her husband’s life in consequence of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
her entreaties. He could not, however, prevail upon her
to stay, but she rose up with her husband, took one child
in her arms, and led the other, and so, after kneeling
before the altar, followed her husband, who, if his mind
was not entirely corrupted by vain ambition, must have
thought exile with such a wife preferable to royalty.
After driving Kleombrotus from the throne, ejecting the
Ephors from office and substituting others chosen by
himself, Leonidas addressed himself to Agis. At first he
tried to persuade him to come out of sanctuary and reign
as his colleague, saying that the citizens had forgiven
him, because they knew that he was young and impetuous,
and had been deceived by Agesilaus. However, as
Agis saw through these devices and remained where he
was, Leonidas left off making these hypocritical offers.
Amphares, Damochares, and Arkesilaus were in the habit
of going to the temple and conversing with him; and once
he came out of the temple in their company to take a
bath, and after bathing was conducted back again by
them in safety. All three were on intimate terms
with him, but Amphares, who had lately borrowed
some rich clothing and valuable plate from Agesistrata,
was inclined to plot against the king and the royal
ladies, that he might not be obliged to restore them.
He, therefore, we are told, lent a ready ear to Leonidas’s
plans, and excited the zeal of the Ephors, one of whom
he was.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="a19"></a> Since Agis lived entirely in the temple, and only
left it in order to bathe, they determined to seize him
when he came out for this purpose. Having one day
watched him bathing they came up and greeted him in a
friendly way, and walked along with him talking and
jesting as young men who are on intimate terms are wont
to do. When they reached the place where a road
branches off to the public prison, Amphares, in virtue of
his Ephorship, laid hold of Agis and said: “Agis, I must
lead you before the Ephors to give an account of your
conduct.” At the same time Damochares, a tall and strong
man, threw his cloak round Agis’s neck and dragged him
along by it. Others now appeared by previous arrangement,
and pushed him from behind, and as no one came to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
help him, he was forced into the prison. Hereupon,
Leonidas appeared with a band of mercenaries, and surrounded
the prison. The Ephors now went in to Agis,
and sent for all the senators of their way of thinking to
come to the prison in order to go through the form of a
trial. Agis laughed at their hypocrisy, but Amphares
told him that it was no laughing matter, and that he
would soon pay a bitter penalty for his rashness.
Another of the Ephors, wishing to offer a means of escape
to Agis, inquired of him whether he had acted on his own
responsibility, or had been compelled to do so by Agesilaus
and Lysander. Agis answered that no man had compelled
him, but that he admired and imitated Lykurgus, and had
aimed at reviving his institutions. Upon this the same
Ephor asked him whether he repented of what he had
done. When the brave youth answered that he never
would repent of his glorious designs, whatever tortures he
might have to suffer for them, the assembly at once condemned
him to death, and bade the prison officials at once
remove him to the place called Dechas, which is a part
of the prison in which criminals are strangled. Seeing
that the servants would not lay hands upon Agis, and
that even those mercenaries who were present shrunk
from such work, because it was held to be unlawful and
impious to lay hands upon the person of the king, Damochares,
after threatening and abusing them, dragged Agis
with his own hands to the place of execution. Many of
the citizens had by this time heard of his arrest, and
many men had assembled with torches in their hands and
were clamouring at the gate of the prison. The mother
and grandmother of Agis were also present, and loudly
demanded that the king of Sparta should have a fair
trial in the presence of his countrymen. For this reason
they within hurried on the execution, as they feared that
if a larger crowd collected Agis would be rescued during
the night.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="a20"></a> While Agis was being led to execution, he saw
one of the servants of the prison weeping and in great
distress. “My man,” said he, “do not weep for me, for I
am a better man than those who are murdering me in
this cruel and illegal fashion.” With these words he, of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
his own accord, put the noose round his neck. Meanwhile
Amphares proceeded to the prison gate. Here Agesistrata
fell at his feet, believing him still to be her friend.
Amphares raised her, saying that Agis would suffer no
violent treatment, and bade her, if she wished, go in and
see her son. As she asked to be accompanied by her
mother, Amphares said that there was no objection to that,
and after receiving them both within the walls, ordered
the prison gates to be closed. He first sent Archidamia,
who was now very old, and greatly respected by her
countrywomen, to the place of execution, and when she
was dead, bade Agesistrata enter. When she saw the
corpse of her son lying on the ground, and her mother
hanging by a halter, she herself assisted the servants to
take her down, laid her body beside that of Agis, and
arranged and covered up the two corpses. She then
knelt and kissed the face of her son, saying, “My child,
thy great piety, goodness, and clemency has brought
thee and us to this death.” Upon this Amphares, who
was watching and listening at the door, came into the
room, and said angrily to Agesistrata, “If you approve
of your son’s deeds, you shall suffer with him.” At these
words Agesistrata rose and offered her neck to the halter,
saying, “I only pray that this may be for the good of
Sparta.”</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="a21"></a> When the sad news was known throughout the
city, and the three corpses brought out of the prison, the
terror which was inspired did not prevent the citizens
from manifesting their sorrow at the deed, and their
hatred of Leonidas and Amphares. No such wicked or
cruel deed, they declared, had been committed in Sparta
since the Dorians settled in Peloponnesus. The very
enemies of the Lacedæmonians generally seemed unwilling
to lay violent hands on their kings when they met them
in battle, and turned aside through reverence of their
exalted position. For this reason, in all the battles which
the Lacedæmonians had fought against the Greeks before
the era of Philip of Macedon, only one king, Kleombrotus,
had fallen on the field of Leuktra; for though the
Messenians aver that Theopompus, a king of Lacedæmon,
was slain by Aristomenes, the Lacedæmonians deny it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and say that he was only wounded. This matter is
doubtful, but Agis was the first king who was put to
death by the Ephors in Lacedæmon, because he had conceived
a noble design and one which was worthy of
Sparta. He was of an age when men’s shortcomings
deserve to be pardoned; and deserves to be blamed by his
friends more than by his enemies, because with an ill-judged
clemency he spared the life of Leonidas, and
trusted in the professions of the rest of his political
enemies.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF KLEOMENES.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="b1"></a> After the death of Agis, as has been related, Leonidas
was not able to seize the person of his brother Archidamus,
who at once fled out of the country, but he brought the
wife of Agis with her newly-born child out of her house,
and forcibly married her to his own son Kleomenes, who
was scarcely come to an age for marriage, because he was
unwilling for her to marry any one else. Indeed Agiatis
was the daughter of Gylippus, and heiress to a great
estate. She was thought to be the most beautiful woman
of her time in all Greece, and was of a noble disposition.
It is said that she made many entreaties not to be forced
into a second marriage, but that after her union with
Kleomenes, although she continued to hate his father
Leonidas, she made a good and affectionate wife to the
young man, who became passionately fond of her, and
sympathised with her loving remembrance of Agis, so
that he would often ask her to tell him about her late
husband, and used to listen with rapt attention while
she explained the designs and projects of Agis. For
Kleomenes was as eager for honour, and had as noble a
mind as Agis himself, and was equally moderate and
simple in his way of life; but he lacked the other’s
discreet and gentle temper, and was of a stirring and
vehement nature, eager to embark on any honourable
enterprise. He thought it the most glorious position of
all to rule over an obedient people; but he took pride also
in bending disobedient subjects to his will, and forcibly
compelling them to move in the path of honour.</p>
<p>II.<a id="b2"></a> He was far from satisfied with the state of things
at Sparta, where the citizens had given themselves up to
luxurious repose, while the king Leonidas cared nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
for public affairs, so long as he was able to gratify his own
love of extravagance and self-indulgence. Public virtue
was entirely gone, and no man cared to profit his country,
but only himself. As for discipline, orderly training of
the young, hardiness of body, and equality, all these
things had perished with Agis, and it was not safe even
to speak of them. We are told that while yet a lad
Kleomenes was instructed in the principles of the Stoic
philosophy by Sphærus of Borysthenes,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">7</a> who visited
Lacedæmon and gave excellent instruction there to the
young. This Sphærus was one of the aptest pupils of
Zeno of Kitium,<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">8</a> and he seems to have admired the
manly spirit of Kleomenes and to have encouraged him in
the pursuit of honour. The ancient hero Leonidas, when
asked what he thought of Tyrtæus, is said to have
answered, “He is good at exciting the minds of the
youth.” Indeed they became filled with enthusiasm by
the poems of Tyrtæus, and fought with reckless daring
in battle: and so also the Stoic philosophy often renders
brave and fiery natures over-daring and venturesome, and
yields the best fruit when applied to a grave and gentle
nature.</p>
<p>III.<a id="b3"></a> When after the death of Leonidas, Kleomenes
succeeded to the throne, he found the state utterly disorganised,
for the rich took no part in politics, and cared
for nothing but their own pleasure and profit, while the
miserable condition of the poor caused them to fight
without spirit in the wars, and to neglect the proper
training of their children. He himself was a king only
in name, as the Ephors had engrossed all real power.
Under these circumstances he at once began to revolve
schemes of reform in his mind, and began to sound the
opinion of his intimate friend Xenares, by enquiring of
him what sort of a king Agis had been, and in what
manner, and with what associates he had made his
attempts at reform. Xenares at first very willingly gave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
him a complete narrative of the whole transaction; but
as he saw that Kleomenes listened with intense interest,
and was deeply excited by the recital of Agis’s designs,
to which he was never weary of listening, Xenares at last
angrily reproached him with not being in his right mind,
and at last broke off all intercourse with him. He did
not, however, tell any one the reason of their being at
variance, but declared that Kleomenes knew well what it
was. Kleomenes, after meeting with this rebuff from
Xenares, imagining that every one else would be of the
same mind, determined to concert his own measures
alone. As he thought that there was more chance of
effecting reforms during war than in time of peace, he
involved Sparta in a war with the Achæans, for which
they themselves furnished the pretext. Aratus, the chief
of the Achæans, had always desired to unite the whole of
the Peloponnesus in one confederacy, and in all his long
political career had steadily kept this object in view, as
he thought that thus, and thus alone, the people of
Peloponnesus would be able to defend themselves against
external foes. Nearly all the tribes of Peloponnesus
joined his confederacy except the Lacedæmonians, the
people of Elis, and such of the Arcadians as were under
Lacedæmonian influence. On the death of Leonidas,
Aratus began to make plundering expeditions into the
territory of the Arcadians, especially those near the
Achæan frontier, in order to see what steps the Lacedæmonians
would take; for he despised Kleomenes as a
young and inexperienced man.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="b4"></a> Upon this the Ephors first sent Kleomenes to
occupy the temple of Athena, near Belbina. This place
was situated in a mountain pass leading into Laconia,
and it was claimed by the citizens of Megalopolis as belonging
to their territory. Kleomenes seized the pass
and fortified it, to which Aratus offered no objection, but
endeavoured by a night march to surprise the cities of
Tegea and Orchomenes. However, the hearts of the
traitors within the walls failed them, and so Aratus led
his army back, hoping that his object had not been discovered.
Kleomenes, by way of jest, now wrote him a
letter affecting to enquire of him in the most friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
terms where he had been to in the night. He answered
that he had heard that Kleomenes was about to erect
fortifications at Belbina, and had marched to prevent his
doing so. To this Kleomenes answered that he was satisfied
that this had been Aratus’s intention. “But,” he
continued, “if you do not mind, please tell me why you
brought scaling ladders and torches with you.” Aratus
laughed at this home-thrust, and enquired what sort of a
youth Kleomenes might be. Damochares, the Lacedæmonian
exile, answered, “If you mean to do anything against
the Lacedæmonians, you must make haste and do it before
this young gamecock’s spurs are grown.” After this the
Ephors ordered Kleomenes, who was encamped in Arcadia
with a few horsemen and three hundred foot, to retire,
as they feared to go to war. But since, as soon as he had
withdrawn, Aratus captured the city of Kaphyæ, they
sent him back again. He captured Methydrium, and
overran Argolis, upon which the Achæans sent an army
of twenty thousand foot and a thousand horse, under the
command of Aristomachus, to attack him. Kleomenes
met them near Pallantium, and was eager to fight, but
Aratus, alarmed at his daring, would not permit the
Achæan general to fight, and drew off his forces, incurring
thereby the anger of the Achæans, and the ridicule and
contempt of the Lacedæmonians, who only amounted to
one-fifth of the enemy’s numbers. This affair gave
Kleomenes great self-confidence, and parodying a saying
of one of the ancient kings, he said to his countrymen
that it was useless nowadays for the Lacedæmonians to
ask either how many their enemies were, or where they
were.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">9</a></p>
<p>V.<a id="b5"></a> Shortly after, as the Achæans were making war
against the Eleans, Kleomenes was sent to aid the latter,
and met with the army of the Achæans returning home,
near the mountain called Lykæum. He attacked their
forces, and utterly routed them, killing many and capturing
numbers of prisoners, so that a report spread throughout
Greece that Aratus himself had perished. But Aratus,
turning the disaster to good account, immediately after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the defeat marched to Mantinea, and as no one expected
him, captured the city and placed a strong garrison in it.
This completely disheartened the Lacedæmonians, who
desired to recall Kleomenes and put an end to the war.
Kleomenes now sent to Messene and invited back Archidamus,
the brother of Agis, who ought to have been on
the throne as the representative of the other royal family,
imagining that if there were two kings reigning at Sparta
at the same time, the power of the Ephors would be
weakened. However, the party who had previously
murdered Agis perceived this, and as they feared that if
Archidamus returned to Sparta he would make them pay
the penalty of their crimes, they welcomed him back and
assisted him to make a secret entry into the city, but
immediately afterwards assassinated him, either against
the will of Kleomenes, as we are told by Phylarchus, or
else with his connivance, in consequence of the representations
of his friends. They indeed bore the chief blame
in the matter, as they were thought to have forced
Kleomenes into consenting to the murder.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="b6"></a>. Kleomenes, determined to carry out his designs of
reform, now proceeded to bribe the Ephors into sending
him out on a new military expedition. He also won over
a considerable number of supporters among the citizens
by means of the lavish expenditure and influence of his
mother Kratesiklea, who, though averse to a second marriage,
is said to have married one of the leading men in
Sparta in order to further her son’s interests.</p>
<p>Kleomenes now took the field at the head of his army,
and captured a small town within the territory of Megalopolis,
named Leuktra.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">10</a> The Achæans under Aratus
promptly came up, and a battle was fought under the
walls of the town, in which part of the army of Kleomenes
was defeated. Aratus however refused to follow up his
advantage, and kept the main body of the Achæans
motionless behind the bed of a torrent. Enraged at his
inaction, Lydiades of Megalopolis charged at the head of
the cavalry under his own command, but got entangled in
the pursuit of the enemy in ground which was cut up by
walls and watercourses. Seeing him thrown into disorder,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Kleomenes sent his Tarentine and Cretan troops to
attack him, by whom Lydiades, fighting bravely, was
overpowered and slain. The Lacedæmonians now recovered
their spirits, and with loud shouts attacked the
Achæans and completely defeated them. Many were
slain, and their corpses were given up to the enemy for
burial, with the exception of that of Lydiades, which
Kleomenes ordered to be brought to himself. He then
attired it in a purple robe, placed a garland upon its head,
and sent it to the city of Megalopolis. This was that
Lydiades who had been despot of Megalopolis, but who
abdicated his throne, restored liberty to his countrymen,
and brought the city to join the Achæan league.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="b7"></a> After this victory Kleomenes became inspired
with fresh confidence, and was convinced that if he only
were allowed undisputed management he would easily
conquer the Achæans. He explained to his step-father
Megistonous that the time had at length come for the
abolition of the Ephors, the redistribution of property,
and the establishment of equality among the citizens,
after which Sparta might again aspire to recover her
ancient ascendancy in Greece. Megistonous agreed, and
communicated his intentions to two or three of his friends.
It chanced that at this time one of the Ephors who was
sleeping in the temple of Pasiphæ dreamed an extraordinary
dream, that in the place where the Ephors sat for the
dispatch of business he saw four chairs removed, and one
alone remaining, while as he wondered he heard a voice
from the shrine say “This is best for Sparta.” When the
Ephor related this dream to Kleomenes, he was at first
much alarmed, and feared that the man had conceived
some suspicion of his designs, but finding that he was
really in earnest recovered his confidence. Taking with
him all those citizens whom he suspected to be opposed to
his enterprise, he captured Heræa and Alsæa, cities
belonging to the Achæan league, revictualled Orchomenus,
and threatened Mantinea. By long marches and counter-marches
he so wearied the Lacedæmonians that at last at
their own request he left the greater part of them in
Arcadia, while he with the mercenaries returned to Sparta.
During his homeward march he revealed his intentions to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
those whom he considered to be most devoted to his
person, and regulated his march so as to be able to fall
upon the Ephors while they were at their evening
meal.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="b8"></a> When he drew near to the city, he sent Eurykleidas
into the dining-room of the Ephors, on the pretence
of bringing a message from the army. After Eurykleidas
followed Phoebis and Therukion, two of the foster-brothers
of Kleomenes, called <i>mothakes</i><a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">11</a> by the Lacedæmonians,
with a few soldiers. While Eurykleidas was parleying
with the Ephors, these men rushed in with drawn swords
and cut them down. The president, Agylæus, fell at the
first blow and appeared to be dead, but contrived to crawl
out of the building unobserved into a small temple, sacred
to Fear, the door of which was usually closed, but which
then chanced to be open. In this he took refuge and shut
the door. The other four were slain, and some few persons,
not more than ten, who came to assist them. No one
who remained quiet was put to death, nor was any one
prevented from leaving the city. Even Agylæus, when
he came out of his sanctuary on the following day, was
not molested.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="b9"></a> The Lacedæmonians have temples dedicated not
only to Fear, but to Death, and Laughter, and the like.
They honour Fear, not as a malevolent divinity to be
shunned, but because they think that the constitutions
of states are mainly upheld by Fear. For this reason,
Aristotle tells us that the Ephors, when they enter upon
their office, issue a proclamation ordering the citizens to
shave the moustache and obey the laws, that the laws
might not be hard upon them. The injunction about
shaving the moustache is inserted, I imagine, in order to
accustom the young to obedience even in the most trivial
matters. It seems to me that the ancient Spartans did
not regard bravery as consisting in the absence of fear,
but in the fear of shame and dread of dishonour; for those
who fear the laws most are the bravest in battle; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>those who most fear disgrace care least for their own
personal safety. The poet was right who said</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Where there is fear, is reverence too;”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>and Homer makes Helen call Priam</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i6">“My father-in-law dear,</div>
<div class="line">Whom most of all I reverence and fear;”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>while he speaks of the Greek army as obeying</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Its chiefs commands in silence and with fear.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Human nature, indeed, leads most men to reverence
those whom they fear; and this is why the Lacedæmonians
placed the temple of Fear close to the dining-hall
of the Ephors, because they invested that office with almost
royal authority.</p>
<p>X.<a id="b10"></a> On the following morning Kleomenes published a
list containing the names of eighty citizens, whom he
required to leave the country, and removed the chairs of
the Ephors, except one, which he intended to occupy himself.
He now convoked an assembly, and made a speech
justifying his recent acts. In the time of Lykurgus, he
said, the kings and the senate shared between them the
supreme authority in the State; and for a long time the
government was carried on in this manner without any
alteration being required, until, during the long wars
with Messene, as the kings had no leisure to attend to
public affairs, they chose some of their friends to sit as
judges in their stead, and these persons acted at first
merely as the servants of the kings, but gradually got all
power into their own hands, and thus insensibly established
a new power in the State. A proof of the truth of this is
to be found in the custom which still prevails, that when
the Ephors send for the king, he refuses to attend at the
first and second summons, but rises and goes to them at
the third. Asteropus, who first consolidated the power of
the Ephors, and raised it to the highest point, flourished
in comparatively recent times, many generations after the
original establishment of the office. If, he went on to say,
the Ephors would have behaved with moderation, it would
have been better to allow them to remain in existence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
but when they began to use their ill-gotten power to
destroy the constitution of Sparta, when they banished
one king, put another to death without trial, and kept
down by terror all those who wished for the introduction
of the noblest and most admirable reforms, they could no
longer be borne. Had he been able without shedding a
drop of blood to drive out of Lacedæmon all those foreign
pests of luxury, extravagance, debt, money-lending, and
those two more ancient evils, poverty and riches, he should
have accounted himself the most fortunate of kings, because,
like a skilful physician, he had painlessly performed
so important an operation upon his country: as it was,
the use of force was sanctioned by the example of Lykurgus,
who, though only a private man, appeared in arms in the
market-place, and so terrified King Charilaus, that he fled
for refuge to the altar of Athena. He, however, being an
honest and patriotic man, soon joined Lykurgus, and
acquiesced in the reforms which he introduced, while the
acts of Lykurgus prove that it is hard to effect a revolution
without armed force, of which he declared that he
had made a most sparing use, and had only put out of the
way those who were opposed to the best interests of Lacedæmon.
He announced to the rest of the citizens that
the land should be divided among them, that they should
be relieved from all their debts, and that all resident
aliens should be submitted to an examination, in order
that the best of them might be selected to become full
citizens of Sparta, and help to defend the city from falling
a prey to Ætolians and Illyrians for want of men to
defend her.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="b11"></a> After this he himself first threw his inheritance
into the common stock, and his example was followed
by his father-in-law Megistonous, his friends, and the
rest of the citizens. The land was now divided, and one
lot was assigned to each of those whom he had banished,
all of whom he said it was his intention to bring back as
soon as order was restored. He recruited the numbers of
the citizens by the admission of the most eligible of the
Periœki to the franchise, and organised them into a body
of four thousand heavy armed infantry, whom he taught
to use the sarissa, or Macedonian pike which was grasped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
with both hands, instead of the spear, and to sling their
shields by a strap instead of using a handle. He next
turned his attention to the education and discipline of the
youth, in which task he was assisted by Sphærus. The
gymnasia and the common meals were soon re-established,
and the citizens, for the most part willingly, resumed
their simple Laconian habits of living. Kleomenes,
fearing to be called a despot, appointed his own brother,
Eukleidas, as his colleague. Then for the first time
were two kings of the same family seen at once in
Sparta.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="b12"></a> As Kleomenes perceived that Aratus and the
Achæans thought that while Sparta was passing through so
perilous a crisis her troops were not likely to leave the
country, he thought that it would be both a spirited and
a useful act to display the enthusiasm of his army to the
enemy. He invaded the territory of Megalopolis, carried
off a large booty, and laid waste a large extent of country.
Finding a company of players on their road from
Messene, he took them prisoners, caused a theatre to
be erected in the enemy’s country, and offered them forty
minæ for a performance for one day, at which he himself
attended as a spectator, not that he cared for the performance,
but because he wished to mock at his enemies,
and to show by this studied insult the enormous superiority
of which he was conscious. At this period his
was the only army, Greek or foreign, which was not
attended by actors, jugglers, dancing-girls, and singers;
but he kept it free from all licentiousness and buffoonery,
as the younger men were nearly always being
practised in martial exercises, while the elders acted
as their instructors; and when they were at leisure
they amused themselves with witty retorts and sententious
Laconian pleasantries. The great value of this
kind of discipline is described at greater length in the
life of Lykurgus.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="b13"></a> In everything Kleomenes himself acted as their
teacher, and example, offering his own simple, frugal life,
so entirely free from vulgar superfluities, as a model of
sobriety for them all to copy; and this added greatly to
his influence in Greece. For when men attended the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
courts of the other kings of that period they were not so
much impressed by their wealth and lavish expenditure
as they were disgusted by their arrogant, overbearing
manners; but when they met Kleomenes, who was every
inch a king, and saw that he wore no purple robes, did not
lounge on couches and litters, and was not surrounded by
a crowd of messengers, doorkeepers, and secretaries, so
as to be difficult of access, but that he himself, dressed
in plain clothes, came and shook them by the hand, and
conversed with them in a kindly and encouraging tone,
they were completely fascinated and charmed by him,
and declared that he alone was a true descendant of
Herakles. His dinner was usually served upon a very
small Laconian table with three couches,<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">12</a> but if he were
entertaining ambassadors or foreigners two additional
couches were added, and his servants somewhat improved
his dinner, not by adding to it made-dishes and pastry,
but by serving a greater abundance of food and a more
liberal allowance of wine. Indeed he blamed one of his
friends, when he heard that when entertaining foreigners
at dinner he had placed before them black broth and
barley cakes: for he said that in such matters, and when
entertaining strangers, it was not well to be too rigidly
Spartan. After the table was removed a tripod was
brought in which supported a bronze bowl full of wine,
two silver pateræ, that held each about a pint, and a
number of very small silver cups, from which any one
drank who wished, for Kleomenes never forced men to
drink against their will. No recitations were performed
for the amusement of the guests; for he himself would
lead the conversation and entertain them over their wine,
partly by asking questions of them and partly by relating
anecdotes to them: for he well knew both how to make
serious subjects interesting, and to be pleasant and witty
without giving offence. He was of opinion that the
habit of other princes, of tempting men into their service
by presents and bribes, was both clumsy and wicked;
but he thought it peculiarly befitting a king to influence
and captivate men’s minds by the charm of his conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and was wont to say that a friend differed only
from a mercenary soldier in that a man wins the one by
the influence of his character and his conversation, and
the other by his money.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="b14"></a> First of all the people of Mantinea made overtures
to him. They admitted him to their city by night, aided
him to drive out the Achæan garrison, and placed themselves
unreservedly in his hands. He, however, restored
them to the enjoyment of their own laws and original
constitution, and marched away the same day to Tegea.
Shortly afterwards by a circuitous march through Arcadia
he arrived before the Achæan city of Pheræ, desiring either
to fight a battle with the Achæans, or to make Aratus
incur the disgrace of retreating and leaving him in
possession of the country: for although Hyperbates was
nominally in command, all real power over the Achæans
was in the hands of Aratus. The Achæans took the field
with their entire force, and encamped at Dymæ, near the
temple called Hekatombæon. When Kleomenes arrived
here he was unwilling to establish himself between the
hostile city of Dymæ and the army of the Achæans, and
challenged them, forced them to fight, and completely
routed their phalanx. He killed many, took a large
number of prisoners, and then, marching to Langon, drove
out the Achæan garrison, and restored the city to the
Eleans.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="b15"></a> As the Achæan power was now quite broken,
Aratus, who was usually elected general every other year,
refused to take office, and excused himself when they
besought him to do so: a dishonourable act, when the
times became more stormy, to desert the helm, and give
up his power to another. Kleomenes at first used very
moderate language to the Achæan ambassadors, but sent
others ordering them to acknowledge him for their
sovereign, and promising that if they did so he would do
them no further hurt, and would at once restore the
prisoners and fortresses which he had taken. As the
Achæans were willing to accept these terms they invited
Kleomenes to a conference at Lerna. It happened, however,
that Kleomenes, after a long march, drank a quantity of
cold water, which caused him to bring up much blood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and to lose his voice. In consequence of this, although
he sent back the most distinguished of his prisoners, he
was obliged to postpone the conference, and went home
to Lacedæmon.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="b16"></a> This mischance ruined Greece, which even now
might have recovered herself, and avoided falling into
the hands of the insolent and rapacious Macedonians.
For Aratus, either because he distrusted and feared
Kleomenes, or else because he grudged him his success, and
thought that after he had for thirty-three years been chief
of the Achæans, it was not to be endured that a young
man should overthrow him, and enter into the fruit of his
labours, at first tried to oppose the Achæans when they
offered to come to terms with the Lacedæmonians; but
as they would not listen to him, because they were cowed
by the boldness of Kleomenes, and also admitted the
justice of the Lacedæmonian claim to be the leading state
in Peloponnesus, as their ancestral right, he adopted a
course which was a disgraceful one for any Greek, but
especially so for him, and one which was most unworthy
of his former political life. He determined to invite Antigonus
into Greece, and to fill the Pelopennesus with those
very Macedonians whom he himself when a lad had chased
out of the country by his capture of the Acro-Corinthus,
although he was regarded with suspicion by all the kings,
and was at variance with them all, and though he had
already accused this very Antigonus himself of every conceivable
crime in his “Memoirs,” which are still extant.
Yet he himself has stated that he suffered much, and risked
much to free Athens from a Macedonian garrison; though
now he led these very men with arms in their hands into
his own native country, and up to his own paternal
hearth. He thought that Kleomenes, a descendant of
Herakles, a king of Sparta, who had restored the simple
ancient Dorian constitution of Lykurgus, as one tightens
the relaxed strings of a lyre, to bring it into tune, was
unworthy to be accounted the ruler of Sikyon and Tritæa;
and in his eagerness to avoid the rough Spartan cloak,
and the Spartan barley bread, and that with which he
especially charged Kleomenes, the destruction of wealth
and the encouragement of poverty, threw himself and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
all Achæa with him, into the arms of the Macedonians,
with all their diadems and their purple robes and their
habits of oriental despotism. That he might avoid acting
under the orders of Kleomenes, he was content to offer
sacrifice at festivals in honour of Antigonus, and himself
to place a garland upon his head, and to lead the pæan
in praise of a man wasted and emaciated by consumption.
And this I write, not from any desire to depreciate
Aratus, for in many respects he proved himself a truly
great and patriotic man, but rather out of pity for the
weakness of human nature, which will not allow even
the most eminent persons to present us with the spectacle
of an entirely unblemished virtue.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="b17"></a> When the Achæans again assembled at Argos to
hold a conference there, and Kleomenes started to go
thither from Tegea, men’s minds were full of hope that
peace would be finally established. But Aratus, who had
already settled the main points of his treaty with Antigonus,
and feared that Kleomenes would either by persuasion
or force bring the assembly over to his views,
sent to him demanding either that he should take three
hundred hostages for his safety and come to the conference
alone, or else meet them with his army outside the walls
at the gymnasium called the Kyllarabium. Kleomenes
on hearing this said that he had not been properly
treated; for Aratus ought to have warned him of this at
once, not have waited till he was almost at the gates of
Argos and then expressed suspicions of his honesty of
purpose and driven him away. He sent a letter to the
assembled Achæans, containing bitter invectives against
Aratus, and as Aratus replied by maligning him in a
public oration, he broke up his camp and sent a herald
with a declaration of war, not to Argos, according to
Aratus, but to Ægium, in order to take the Achæans by
surprise. The Achæan cities were all ripe for revolt, as
the populace hoped for a redistribution of the land and
cancelling of debts if they joined the Spartans, while the
leading men were all jealous of the power and influence
of Aratus, and some of them hated him as the traitor who
was bringing the Macedonians into Peloponnesus. Relying
upon the prevalence of this feeling Kleomenes invaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Achaia, took Pellene by surprise, and drove out the
garrison and the Achæan inhabitants. Soon afterwards
he captured the cities of Pheneus and Penteleum.</p>
<p>The Achæans of Corinth and Sikyon now began to fear
that his partisans were plotting to deliver up those cities
to him, and in consequence sent their cavalry and foreign
mercenaries away from Argos to guard those towns, while
they themselves proceeded to Argos to hold the Nemean
festival there. Kleomenes, rightly judging that his appearance
at a time when the city was full of a disorderly
crowd of people who were come to attend the feasts and
games would produce great confusion, marched up to the
walls by night, seized the place called the ‘Shield,’ which
is just above the theatre, and is very difficult of access,
and so terrified the citizens that no one attempted to offer
any resistance. They willingly agreed to admit a Spartan
garrison, to give twenty of their chief men as hostages
for their loyalty, and to become the allies of the Lacedæmonians,
acknowledging their supremacy.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="b18"></a> This exploit added not a little to the reputation
and power of Kleomenes. None of the ancient kings of
Sparta could ever make themselves masters of Argos,
although they often attempted to do so; and even that
most brilliant general King Pyrrhus, though he forced his
way into the city, could not take it, but perished, and
with him a great part of his army. For these reasons,
the skill and audacity of Kleomenes were the more
admired: and those who had before ridiculed his attempts
to bring back the days of Solon and Lykurgus by the
cancelling of debts and redistribution of land, now became
entirely convinced that these measures had been the
cause of the revival of Sparta. The Spartans before this
had been so feeble and helpless, that the Aetolians invaded
Laconia and carried off a booty of fifty thousand slaves,
on which occasion it is said that an old Spartan observed
that the enemy had greatly benefited Laconia by relieving
it from its burdens. Yet a short time after this, by the
restoration of their former constitution, and by re-establishing
the ancient system of training, they made as
magnificent a display of discipline and valour as if
Lykurgus himself were alive and at the head of affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
for they gained for Sparta the first place in Greece, and
won the whole of Peloponnesus by the sword.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="b19"></a> The submission of Argos to Kleomenes was soon
followed by that of Phlius and Kleonæ. During these
events Aratus was at Corinth, busily engaged in searching
for the partisans of the Lacedæmonians. When the
news of the fall of these cities reached Corinth, as he
observed that the city of Corinth was eager to join
Kleomenes and leave the Achæan league, he summoned the
citizens to meet in the public assembly, and himself made
his way unperceived to the gate. He had already sent
his horse thither, and mounting, fled to Sikyon. The
Corinthians now hurried to Argos to surrender their city
to Kleomenes; in such haste, writes Aratus in his ‘Memoirs,’
that they foundered all their horses. Kleomenes
reproached them for allowing Aratus to escape, but shortly
afterwards sent Megistonous to him, asking him to hand
over the citadel of Corinth, which was in possession of an
Achæan garrison, and offering him a large sum of money.
He answered that the course of affairs was not in his
power, but that he was rather in theirs. These particulars
we have extracted from Aratus’s own writings.
Kleomenes now marched from Argos to Corinth, receiving
on the way the submission of Trœzene, Epidaurus, and
Hermione. As the garrison refused to surrender the
citadel, he built a rampart round it, and sending for the
friends and representatives of Aratus, bade them take
charge of his house and property during his absence. He
now sent the Messenian Tritymallus to Aratus, with
instructions to propose to him that the garrison of Acro-Corinthus
should be composed partly of Spartan and
partly of Achæan troops, while he himself privately
offered him double the amount of the pension which he
received from King Ptolemy of Egypt. However, as
Aratus refused to listen to his overtures, but sent his own
son with the other hostages to Antigonus, and persuaded
the Achæans to pass a decree to hand over the Acro-Corinthus
to Antigonus, Kleomenes invaded the territory
of Sikyon and laid it waste, and also took the property of
Aratus when it was publicly presented to him by the
people of Corinth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>
<p>XX.<a id="b20"></a> When Antigonus crossed the Geranean mountains
with a large force, Kleomenes did not think it necessary
to guard the isthmus, but determined to fortify the
mountains called Onea, and by holding that strong
position, to protract the war and wear out the Macedonian
force, rather than fight a pitched battle with their
phalanx. By this line of policy he reduced Antigonus to
great straits; for he had made no preparations for feeding
his troops for more than a short time, and yet to force his
way in over the isthmus was a difficult operation while
Kleomenes barred the way. An attempt which he made
to steal through by Lechæum<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">13</a> at night was repulsed with
considerable loss; so that Kleomenes and his friends,
elated by their victory, supped merrily together, while
Antigonus was at his wit’s end to know what to do. He
even began to meditate marching to the promontory of
Heræum, and conveying his forces over the Corinthian
gulf to Sikyon, an operation which would have required
much time and many ships. However, late in the
evening there arrived certain friends of Aratus by sea
from Argos, inviting him to come thither, as the Argives
intended to revolt from Kleomenes. The prime mover in
this revolt was one Aristoteles, who easily prevailed upon
the people to rise, because they were disappointed with
Kleomenes, who had not cancelled all their debts as they
hoped he would. Aratus now took fifteen hundred of
Antigonus’s soldiers and proceeded by sea to Epidaurus.
Aristoteles however did not wait for his arrival, but led
the citizens to attack the garrison in the citadel, assisted
by Timoxenus with a body of Achæans from Sikyon.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="b21"></a> Intelligence of this movement reached Kleomenes
about the second watch of the night. He at once sent for
Megistonous, and angrily ordered him at once to go to the
assistance of the garrison of Argos; for it was he who had
so confidently assured Kleomenes of the loyalty of the
Argives, and had dissuaded him from banishing those
whom he suspected from the city. Having detached
Megistonous with two thousand men on this service, he
himself turned his attention to Antigonus, and pacified the
people of Corinth by assuring them that nothing had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>happened at Argos except a slight disturbance which would
be easily suppressed. However, as Megistonous was killed
while forcing his way into the city, and the garrison were
hard pressed, and kept sending messengers to Kleomenes
begging for assistance, he, fearing that if the enemy
gained Argos they might cut him off from Laconia, and
sack the defenceless city of Sparta, withdrew his army
from Corinth. He lost this city at once, for Antigonus
instantly entered it and placed a garrison in it. He now
proceeded to assault the city wall of Argos, and concentrated
his troops for this purpose. He broke through the
vaults supporting the part of the city called the ‘Shield,’
forced his way in, and joined his garrison, who were still
holding out against the Achæans. He now, by the use of
scaling ladders, captured some of the strong places in the
city, and cleared the streets of the enemy by means of his
Cretan archers. When however he saw Antigonus marching
down from the mountains to the plain with his
phalanx in battle array, and saw the Macedonian cavalry
pouring along towards the city, he despaired of success,
and collecting all his troops into one mass, led them safely
out of the city. He had in a wonderfully short time
effected great things, and had all but made himself master
of the whole of Peloponnesus: but now he lost it all as
quickly as he had won it, for some of his allies at once
deserted him, and many shortly afterwards surrendered
their cities to Antigonus.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="b22"></a> As Kleomenes was marching into the city of
Tegea at nightfall, on his return from this disastrous
campaign, he was met by messengers bearing the news of
a still greater calamity, the death of his wife Agiatis, of
whom he was so fond that even when in the full tide of
success he never would remain continuously with his army,
but used constantly to return to Sparta to see her. He
was terribly grieved and cast down, as one would expect
a young man to be on losing so beautiful and excellent a
wife, yet he did not allow his noble spirit to be crushed
by his sorrow, but without showing any outward signs of
grief in his voice or countenance, continued to give his
orders to his officers, and to take measures for placing
Tegea in a posture of defence. At daybreak next morning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
he returned to Lacedæmon, and after lamenting his
misfortune with his mother and his children, began to
consider by what policy he might save his country.</p>
<p>Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, now offered him assistance
on the condition of receiving his mother and children as
hostages. For a long time he shrank from mentioning
this proposal to his mother, and often conversed with her
without having the courage to allude to it, until she suspected
that he had something on his mind, and inquired
of his friends whether there was not some subject about
which he hesitated to speak to her. At last Kleomenes
brought himself to mention Ptolemy’s proposal to her.
On hearing it, she laughed loudly, and said, “This, then,
is that which you have so long been fearing to tell me.
Pray place me and the children on board ship as soon as
possible, and send us to any place where this body of
mine may be useful to Sparta, before it be uselessly consumed
by old age at home.”</p>
<p>When all was prepared for her voyage, Kratesiklea proceeded
to Tænarus escorted by Kleomenes with all his
troops under arms. Before embarking she retired alone
with him into the temple of Poseidon, where, after embracing
him as he sorrowed at her departure, she said,
“Now, king of the Lacedæmonians, take care when we
come out that no one sees us weeping or doing anything
unworthy of Sparta. This lies in our own power; but good
or evil fortune befalls us according to the will of Heaven.”</p>
<p>Saying thus, she fixed her eyes upon the ship, walked
swiftly to it carrying the child, and bade the pilot start
at once. When she reached Egypt, as she heard that
Ptolemy had received an embassy from Antigonus, and
was told that although the Achæans wished to come to
terms with him, he had feared on her account to make
peace with them without consulting Ptolemy, she wrote
to him bidding him act worthily of Sparta, and consult
her interests, and not fear to displease Ptolemy because
of what he might do to an old woman and an infant. So
great a spirit is she said to have shown in her misfortunes.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="b23"></a> Antigonus now advanced, took Tegea, and
allowed his troops to plunder Orchomenus and Mantinea.
Kleomenes, who was confined to the territory of Lacedæmon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
proceeded to emancipate all helots who could pay
a sum of five Attic minæ for their freedom, by which
means he raised a sum of five hundred talents. He also
organised a special corps of two thousand men, armed
after the Macedonian fashion, with which he hoped to be
able to meet the Leukaspids,<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">14</a> or white-shielded troops of
Antigonus, and proceeded to attempt a wonderful and
surprising feat of arms.</p>
<p>The city of Megalopolis at that time was itself quite as
large and as powerful as Sparta, and had close at hand
the army of the Achæans, and that of Antigonus himself,
whom the people of Megalopolis had been especially eager
to invite into Peloponnesus. This city Kleomenes
determined to pounce upon: (no other word expresses the
speed with which he surprised it). He ordered his troops
to provision themselves for five days, and led them to
Sellasia, as though he intended to invade Argolis. From
Sellasia he marched into the territory of Megalopolis,
halted at Rhœteum for supper, and thence proceeded
along the road by Helikus straight towards Megalopolis.
When he was close to it he detached Panteus with two
regiments to attack a part of the wall lying between two
towers, which he had heard was often left unguarded,
while he moved slowly forward with the main body.
Panteus not only found that spot, but a great extent of
the city wall unguarded. While he was engaged in
throwing down the wall and killing those who attempted
to defend it, Kleomenes came up, and was within the city
with his army before the people of Megalopolis knew of
his arrival.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="b24"></a> When at last the inhabitants discovered the
extent of their misfortune, some snatched up what they
could and fled at once, while others got under arms and
endeavoured to drive out the enemy. In this they could
not succeed, but they enabled the fugitives to escape
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>unmolested, so that no more than a thousand souls
remained in the city, as all the rest got safe with their
wives and children to Messene. Of those who offered
resistance but a few were slain, and a very small number
were taken prisoners, amongst whom were Lysandridas
and Thearidas, the two most important persons in
Megalopolis. On this account the soldiers who took them
brought them at once to Kleomenes. Lysandridas, as
soon as he saw Kleomenes at a distance, called out loudly
to him, “King of the Lacedæmonians, now you have an
opportunity to add to your glory by a deed even more
noble and more worthy of a king than that which you
have achieved!” Kleomenes, suspecting what he meant,
asked, “What do you mean, Lysandridas? do you bid me
give you back your city?” “That is what I bid you to
do,” answered Lysandridas; “and I advise you not to
ruin so great a city, but to fill it with friends and trusty
allies, by restoring it to the people of Megalopolis, and
becoming their saviour.” To this Kleomenes, after a short
silence, replied, “It is hard to believe this; but let us
ever prefer honour to profit.” Saying this he sent his
prisoners to Messene, and a herald with them, who offered
to restore the city to the people of Megalopolis, on the
condition that they should desert the Achæans and
become the friends and allies of the Spartans. However,
Philopimen would not allow his countrymen to break
their faith with the Achæans and accept this wise and
generous offer. He declared that Kleomenes did not
intend to give them back their city, but wanted to get
possession of them as well as of their city, and with
violent abuse drove Thearidas and Lysandridas out of
the Messenian country. This was that Philopœmen who
afterwards became the general of the Achæans and won
great distinction, as will be found in the life of him
which I have written.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="b25"></a> When this answer was brought back to Kleomenes,
who had hitherto carefully kept the city unharmed,
and had not allowed any one to appropriate the
most trifling article, he became furious with disappointment.
He plundered the city, sent all the statues and
pictures to Sparta, utterly destroyed all the best part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the city, and returned home, for he feared Antigonus and
the Achæans. They, however, did not offer to attack
him: for they were engaged in holding a conference at
Ægium. Here Aratus ascended the tribune, and for a
long time wept with his face hidden in his gown. At
last, as the others in wonder bade him tell them the cause
of his grief, he said that Megalopolis had been ruined by
Kleomenes. On hearing this the assembly at once broke
up. The Achæans were terror-stricken at the suddenness
and importance of the blow, and Antigonus determined
to proceed to the assistance of the people of
Megalopolis, but as it took a long time to assemble his
troops from their winter-quarters, he ordered them to stay
where they were, and himself with a small force marched
to Argos. Kleomenes now engaged in a second enterprise,
which appeared completely insane, but which is said by
the historian Polybius to show consummate generalship.
As he knew that all the Macedonian troops were scattered
over the country in winter-quarters, and that Antigonus
with a few mercenary troops was spending the winter at
Argos with his friends, he invaded the Argive territory,
thinking that either he should shame Antigonus into a
battle, and beat him, or else that if he did not dare to
fight, the Argives would be disgusted with him. And
so it fell out. The Argives, seeing their country spoiled
by Kleomenes, were greatly enraged, and gathering together
before the house in which Antigonus was lodging,
excitedly called upon him either to fight or to resign his
post as commander-in-chief in favour of a better man.
But Antigonus, like a prudent general as he was, thought
it more disgraceful to run foolish risks and incur unnecessary
danger than to hear himself called hard names by
the mob, and refused to leave the city, but stood constant
in his original policy. Kleomenes, after marching up to
the gates of Argos, ostentatiously ravaged the country,
and returned home unmolested.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="b26"></a> Shortly afterwards, hearing that Antigonus
had again advanced to Tegea, intending to invade Laconia
by that route, Kleomenes quickly assembled his army,
marched by a different road, avoiding Antigonus, and at
daybreak appeared near the city of Argos, where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
ravaged the plain country, not reaping the corn, as
invaders usually do, with sickles and swords, but beating
down with great clubs, so that his soldiers in sheer sport
as they marched along were able to destroy the whole
crop without trouble. When they reached the gymnasium
of Kyllarabis some of the officers proposed to set it
on fire; but Kleomenes forbade it, saying that even in
destroying Megalopolis he had been guided by anger
rather than by honour. Antigonus at first retired directly
towards Argos, but afterwards occupied all the passes by
which the Lacedæmonians could retreat. Kleomenes
affected to set him at defiance, and sent a herald to Argos
to demand the keys of the temple of Hera (between
Argos and Mycenæ), in order that he might offer sacrifice
there before retiring. After insulting the Argives by
this ironical request, he offered sacrifice outside the
temple, for the doors remained locked, and led away his
army to Phlius. From thence he marched to Mount
Oligyrtus, where he defeated the Macedonian troops who
guarded the pass, and returned home by way of Orchomenus,
having inspired his countrymen with hope and
confidence, and having proved to his enemies that he was
a consummate general, capable of conducting the most important
operations. It was indeed no small feat for him,
with only the resources of one small state at his disposal,
to make war against the power of Macedonia and all
the cities of the Peloponnesus, with Antigonus for their
paymaster, and not only to prevent the enemy’s setting
foot in Laconia, but to lay waste their country, and take
such large and important cities from them.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="b27"></a> However, he who first called money the
sinews of war must have had this war in his mind. So
also Demades, when the Athenians wished to man a fleet
at a time when they had no money, observed that they
must make bread before they could make a voyage.
Archidamus, too, who was king of Sparta at the opening
of the Peloponnesian war, when his allies asked him to
fix the limit of their several contributions, answered that
the consumption of war is unlimited. For just as trained
athletes in time overpower their antagonist in spite of
his strength and skill, so Antigonus, having vast resources<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
to draw upon, wearied out and overpowered Kleomenes,
who had the greatest difficulty in paying his mercenary
troops and feeding his countrymen. In other respects the
long duration of the contest was in Kleomenes’s favour,
as Antigonus had troubles at home which made the
contest a more equal one. The barbarians, in his absence,
always overran and plundered the outskirts of the kingdom
of Macedonia, and at this period an army of Illyrians
had invaded the country from the north, against whose
depredations the Macedonians besought Antigonus to
return and protect them. The letter calling upon him to
return was very nearly delivered to him before the
decisive battle of the war; and had he received it, he
would no doubt have returned home at once and taken a
long farewell of the Achæans. However, fortune, who
delights to show that the most important events are
decided by the merest trifles, caused the embassy with
the letters for the recall of Antigonus to reach him just
after the battle of Sellasia, in which Kleomenes lost his
army and his country. This makes the misfortune of
Kleomenes yet more pitiable; for if he had avoided a
battle for two days longer, he never need have fought at
all, as the Macedonians would have retreated, and left
him to make what terms he pleased with the Achæans:
whereas, as has been explained, his want of money forced
him to fight, and that too when, according to Polybius,
he had only twenty thousand men to oppose to thirty
thousand.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="b28"></a> In the battle he acted like a great general,
and the Spartans fought with desperate courage, while
the mercenary troops also behaved well; but he was
overpowered by the Macedonian armament and by the
irresistible weight of their phalanx. The historian
Phylarchus says that Kleomenes was ruined by treachery,
for Antigonus sent his Illyrians and Akarnanians to make
a flank march and attack one of the enemy’s wings, which
was commanded by Eukleidas, the brother of Kleomenes,
and there placed the rest of his army in battle array.
Kleomenes, who was watching the enemy from an eminence,
could not see the Illyrian and Akarnanian troops,
and suspected some manœuvre of the kind. He sent for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Damoteles, the chief of the Spartan secret-service,<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">15</a> and
ordered him to explore the ground on both flanks, and
see that no attack was meditated in that direction. As
Damoteles, who is said to have been bribed by Antigonus,
answered that all was well on the flanks, and that he had
better give his entire attention to the enemy in front,
Kleomenes believed him, and at once charged the army
of Antigonus. The furious attack of the Spartans drove
back the Macedonian phalanx, and Kleomenes forced it to
retreat before him for a distance of about five stadia.
Then, as he found that his brother Eukleidas on the other
wing was surrounded by the enemy, he halted, and looking
towards him, said, “You are gone, my dearest brother;
you have fought bravely, and are a noble model to the
Spartan youth, a noble theme for Spartan maidens’
songs.” Then, as the entire division under Eukleidas
was cut to pieces, and the victors attacked his own men,
who were thrown into confusion and could no longer
stand their ground, he escaped from the field as best he
could. It is said that many of the mercenaries were
slain, and that of the Lacedæmonians, who were six
thousand in all, only two hundred remained alive.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="b29"></a> Kleomenes, when he reached Sparta, advised
the citizens whom he met to submit to Antigonus, and
declared that he himself, whether he lived or died, would
do what was best for Sparta. As he saw the women
running up to those who had accompanied him in his
flight, taking their arms from them and offering them
drink, he retired into his own house, where his mistress,
a girl of a good family of Megalopolis, whom he had taken
to live with him after his wife’s death, came up to him as
usual, and wished to attend upon him on his return from
the wars. But he would neither drink, although excessively
thirsty, nor sit down, weary though he was, but in
his armour as he was took hold of one of the columns with
his hand, leaned his face upon his elbow, and after resting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>a short time in this posture while he revolved in his mind
every kind of plan, proceeded with his friends to Grythium.
Here they embarked on a ship which had been prepared
in case of such a disaster, and sailed away.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="b30"></a> After the battle Antigonus advanced upon Sparta,
and made himself master of the city. He treated the Lacedæmonians
with kindness, and offered no kind of insult to
their glorious city, but permitted them to retain their
laws and constitution, sacrificed to the gods, and on the
third day withdrew, as he had learned that a terrible war
was raging in Macedonia, and that his kingdom was being
ravaged by the barbarians. His health was already
affected by a disease, which ended in consumption. However,
he bore up against it, and was able to die gloriously
after having recovered his kingdom, won a great victory
over the barbarians, and killed a great number of them.
Phylarchus tells us that he ruptured his lungs by shouting
in the battle itself, and this seems the most probable
account, but the common report at the time was that
while shouting aloud after the victory, “O happy day!”
he brought up a vast quantity of blood and fell sick of
a fever, of which he died. Such was the fate of Antigonus.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="b31"></a> Kleomenes sailed from Kythera to another
island, named Ægialea. As he was about to cross over
from this place to Cyrene, one of his friends named
Therykion, a brilliant warrior and a man of lofty, unbending
spirit, said to him in private, “My king, we have
lost the opportunity of falling by the noblest of deaths in
the battle, although we publicly declared that Antigonus
should never enter Sparta unless he first passed over
the dead body of the king. However, the course which
is next to this in honour is still open to us. Why should
we recklessly embark on this voyage merely in order to
exchange our misfortunes at home for others in a distant
country? If it be not disgraceful for the sons of Herakles
to submit to the successors of Philip and Alexander, we
shall save ourselves a long voyage by delivering ourselves
up to Antigonus, who is probably as much better than
Ptolemy as the Macedonians are better than the Egyptians.
If, on the other hand, we scorn to become the subjects of
our conqueror, why should we become subject to one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
has not conquered us, and so prove ourselves inferior to two
men instead of one, by becoming the courtiers of Ptolemy
as well as fleeing before Antigonus? Is it on account of
your mother that we are going to Egypt? If so, you will
indeed make a glorious appearance before her, and you
will be much to be envied when she shows her son to the
ladies of Ptolemy’s court, an exile instead of a king.
While we are still masters of our own swords, and are
still in sight of Laconia, let us put ourselves beyond the
reach of further misfortunes, and make amends to those
who died for Sparta at Sellasia, rather than settle ourselves
in Egypt, and inquire whom Antigonus has been
pleased to appoint satrap of Lacedæmon?”<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">16</a></p>
<p>To these remarks of Therykion Kleomenes answered,
“Wretch, do you think that by suicide, the easiest way
out of all difficulties, and one which is within every man’s
reach, you will gain a reputation for bravery, and will
not rather be flying before the enemy more disgracefully
than at Sellasia? More powerful men than ourselves
have ere now been defeated, either by their own evil fortune
or by the excessive numbers of their enemy: but
the man who refuses to bear fatigue and misery, and the
scorn of men, is conquered by his own cowardice. A self-inflicted
death ought to be an honourable action, not a
dishonourable means of escape from the necessity for
action. It is disgraceful either to live or to die for oneself
alone: yet this is the course which you recommend,
namely, that I should fly from my present misery without
ever again performing any useful or honourable action.
I think that it is both your duty and mine, not to despair
of our country: for when all hope fails us, we can easily
find means to die.” To this Therykion made no answer,
but as soon as he had an opportunity left Kleomenes, sought
a retired spot upon the beach, and killed himself.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="b32"></a> Kleomenes sailed from Ægialea to Libya,
where he was received with royal honours and conducted
to Alexandria. At his first interview Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">17</a> treated
him with mere ordinary politeness, but when by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
converation with him he discovered his great abilities, and in
the familiar intercourse of daily life observed the noble
Spartan simplicity of his habits, and saw with how proud
and unbroken a spirit he bore his misfortunes, he thought
him a much more trustworthy friend than any of the
venal throng of courtiers by whom he was surrounded.
Ptolemy felt real regret at having neglected so great a
man, and allowed Antigonus to gain so much glory and
power at his expense. He showed Kleomenes great
kindness and honour, and encouraged him by promising
that he would place a fleet and a sum of money at his
disposal, which would enable him to return to Greece and
recover his throne. He settled upon him a yearly allowance
of twenty-four talents, the most part of which he
and his friends, who still retained their simple Spartan
habits, distributed in charity among the Greek refugees
who had found an asylum in Egypt.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="b33"></a> The elder Ptolemy died before he could accomplish
his promise of attempting to restore Kleomenes to
his throne; and amidst the drunken licence of the court
of his successor, the affairs of Kleomenes were entirely
neglected. The young king<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">18</a> was so given up to wine
and women, that his soberest moments were spent in
organising religious ceremonies in the palace, and in
carrying a kettledrum in honour of the mother of the
gods. The whole of the public business of the kingdom
was managed by Agathoklea, the king’s mistress, her
mother, and the brothel-keeper Œnanthes. Yet even here
it seems that the assistance of Kleomenes was needed, for
the king, fearing his brother Magas, who through his
mother had great influence with the army, attached himself
in a special manner to Kleomenes, and made him a
member of his own secret council, desiring to make use of
him to kill his brother. Kleomenes, although every one
in the court bade him do this, refused, saying that it would
rather be his duty, if it were possible, to raise up more
brothers for the king, to strengthen and confirm his
throne. When Sosibius, the most powerful of the king’s
favourites, said that the mercenary troops were not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>depended upon while Magas was alive, Kleomenes answered
that he might be quite easy on that score, for
more than three thousand of the mercenaries were Peloponnesians,
and at the slightest sign from him would seize
their arms and rally round him. This speech was thought
at the time to be a great proof of the loyalty of Kleomenes,
and gave the courtiers a great idea of his power; but
afterwards, as Ptolemy’s weakness of character produced
cowardice, and after the manner of empty-headed men
he began to think it safest to suspect every one, these
words made the courtiers fear Kleomenes, as having a
dangerous power over the mercenaries; and many of them
were wont to say, “This man moves among us like a
lion among a flock of sheep.” Indeed the demeanour of
Kleomenes in the Egyptian palace, as he calmly and
quietly watched the course of events, naturally suggested
this simile.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="b34"></a> Kleomenes gave up asking for a fleet and an
army; but hearing that Antigonus was dead, and that the
Achæans were involved in a war with the Ætolians,
while his presence was imperatively demanded at home,
as all Peloponnesus seemed to be going to ruin, he desired
to be sent home alone with his friends. However, he
could persuade no one to accede to this request, as the
king thought of nothing but his concubines and his revels,
and Sosibius, upon whom devolved the whole conduct of
affairs, although he knew that Kleomenes would be dangerous
and hard to manage if kept in Egypt against his
will, yet feared to set at large so daring and enterprising
a man, who had gained a thorough insight into the utter
rottenness of the Ptolemaic dynasty. For Kleomenes could
not be bribed into remaining quiet, but as the bull<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">19</a> sacred
to Apis, although he is abundantly fed and supplied with
every luxury, yet longs to frisk and range about as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>nature intended, so he cared for none of their effeminate
pleasures,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“but wore his soul away”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>like Achilles,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Idling at home, though eager for the fray.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XXXV.<a id="b35"></a> While his affairs were in this posture, there
arrived at Alexandria one Nikagoras, a Messenian, who
pretended to be a friend to Kleomenes, but really hated
him bitterly, because he had once sold him a fair estate,
but had never received the money, either because Kleomenes
intended to cheat him, or because he was unable to
pay him on account of the wars. As this man was disembarking
from his ship, Kleomenes, who happened to be
walking upon the quay, saw him, and at once warmly
greeted him, and inquired what business had brought him
to Egypt. Nikagoras returned his salutation with equal
friendliness, and said that he had brought over some fine
horses for the king’s use in the wars. At this Kleomenes
laughed, and said, “I had rather you had brought singing-girls
or beautiful boys, for they are what please the king
best.” Nikagoras listened to this remark with a smile,
but a few days afterwards he reminded Kleomenes of the
estate which he had bought, and asked him to pay the
price, saying that he would not have pressed for it if he
had not sustained losses on his cargo. As Kleomenes replied
that all his pension from the king was spent, Nikagoras
in a rage repeated to Sosibius the sarcasm which he had
used. Sosibius was much pleased to hear of it, but as he
wished to have some graver matter of which to accuse
him to the king, he persuaded Nikagoras to write a letter
before he left Egypt, accusing Kleomenes of a design to
make himself master of Cyrene, if the king put him in
possession of a fleet and army. Nikagoras wrote the letter,
and sailed away to Greece; and after forty days Sosibius
took the letter and showed it to Ptolemy, as though he
had just received it. By this means he so wrought upon
the young king’s mind, that he confined Kleomenes in
a large house, and placed a guard before all the doors,
although he continued to allow him his pension as before.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="b36"></a> This treatment was in itself <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>sufficiently
grievous to Kleomenes, and made him fear that something
worse was in store. Now Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermes,
who was a friend of the king’s, had always been on good
terms with Kleomenes, and they had been in the habit of
conversing familiarly together. This man now, at Kleomenes’s
own request, came to see him, and talked amicably
with him, explaining away all which had appeared suspicious
about the king’s conduct. As he was leaving the
house, without noticing that Kleomenes had followed him
to the door, he harshly reproved the guard for keeping
such careless watch over so great and savage a monster.
Kleomenes himself heard him say this, and before Ptolemy
observed him, retired and told his friends what he had
heard. They at once abandoned all hope, and fiercely
determined to avenge themselves on Ptolemy for his
wickedness and arrogance, and die as became Spartans,
not wait to be butchered like fat cattle. They thought
that it was intolerable that Kleomenes should have disdained
to make terms with Antigonus, who was a soldier
and a man of action, and should sit waiting for the pleasure
of a timbrel-playing king, who as soon as he was at leisure
from his kettle-drummings and revellings, intended to
murder him.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="b37"></a> As soon as they had formed this resolution,
as it happened that Ptolemy had gone to Canopus, they
spread a report that the king had given orders for the
guard to be removed. Next, observing the custom of the
kings of Egypt, which was to send a dinner and various
presents to those who are about to be released from
confinement, the friends of Kleomenes prepared many
presents of this kind and sent them to him, deceiving the
guard, who believed that they had been sent by the king.
Kleomenes offered sacrifice, and gave the soldiers on
guard an ample share of the meat, while he himself put
on a garland and feasted with his friends. It is said that
they proceeded to action sooner than had been originally
intended, because Kleomenes perceived that one of the
servants who was in the plot had left the house, though
he had only gone to visit his mistress. Fearing that he
meant to denounce them, as soon as it was noon, and the
guard were sleeping off their wine, Kleomenes put on <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>his
tunic, slit up the seam over the right shoulder, seized his
naked sword, and sallied forth with his friends similarly
arrayed, thirteen in all. One of them named Hippitas,
who was lame, came boldly out with the rest, but finding
that they proceeded slowly to enable him to keep up with
them, begged them to kill him, and not spoil their plot by
waiting for a useless man. It happened that one of the
Alexandrians was leading a horse past the door; they at
once took it, placed Hippitas on its back, and ran quickly
through the streets, calling upon the populace to rise and
set itself free. The people, it appears, had spirit enough
to admire Kleomenes, but no one dared to follow or help
him. Three of the conspirators met Ptolemy, the son of
Chrysermes, coming out of the palace, and killed him:
and when another Ptolemy, the governor of the city,
drove towards them in a chariot, they rushed to meet him,
scattered his body-guard, dragged him out of the chariot
and killed him. They now made their way to the citadel,
intending to break open the prison and make use of the
prisoners to swell their numbers; but the guardians of
the prison had closed the gates effectually before they
arrived, and Kleomenes, failing in this attempt, roamed
through the city without finding any one to join him, as
all fled in terror at his approach. At last he stopped, and
said to his friends, “No wonder women bear rule in a city
where men fear to be free.” He now bade them all end
their lives worthily of him and of themselves. First of
all Hippitas, at his own request, was struck dead by one
of the younger men; after which, each man deliberately
and fearlessly inflicted upon himself a mortal stab, with
the exception of Panteus, who had been the first to break
into the city of Megalopolis. This man, the handsomest
and best warrior of all the Spartan youth, was especially
loved by the king, and was ordered by him to wait till
all the rest were dead, and then to put an end to his life.
When they had all fallen, Panteus pricked each man with
his dagger, to make certain that none of them were alive.
When he pricked Kleomenes in the ankle he saw his face
contract. He kissed him and sat down beside him until
he was quite dead, and then, embracing the corpse, killed
himself upon it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="b38"></a> Thus perished Kleomenes, after having
reigned over Sparta for thirteen years, as described above.
The news of his death was soon bruited abroad, and
Kratesiklea, although a woman of high spirit, was so
overcome by her misfortune that she embraced the children
and wept for Kleomenes. Upon this the eldest boy leaped
up, and before any one knew what he was going to do,
threw himself headlong from the roof of the house. He
was much hurt, but not killed, and was taken up, crying
out and reproaching his friends because they would not
allow him to die. When Ptolemy heard the news, he
ordered the corpse of Kleomenes to be flayed and exposed
on a gibbet, and his children, his mother, and her attendants
to be put to death. Among these was the wife of
Panteus, the fairest and noblest-looking of them all. She
and her husband had only recently been married when
their misfortunes began. When Panteus left Sparta she
wished to accompany him, but her parents would not
allow her to do so, and locked her up in their house.
But she shortly afterwards procured a horse and a little
money, and made her escape by night. She rode all the
way to Taenarum, where she found a ship about to sail to
Egypt, on board of which she crossed the sea, joined her
husband, and cheerfully shared his exile. She now, when
the soldiers came to lead away Kratesiklea, took her by
the hand, held up the train of her dress, and bade her be
of good courage; although Kratesiklea herself was not
afraid to die, but only asked one favour, that she might
die before her children. When they arrived at the place
of execution, the children were first killed before the eyes
of Kratesiklea, and then she herself. All she said was:
“My children, whither have you come?” The wife of
Panteus, being a tall and robust woman, girded up her
robe, and arranged each of the corpses as decently as her
means permitted. After she had paid the last offices to
each of them she prepared herself for death, bared her
neck, allowed no one to approach her but the executioner,
and died like a heroine, without requiring any one to
arrange her corpse. Thus the modesty which she had
observed throughout her life, did not desert her even when
she was dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="b39"></a> Thus gloriously, even during its last days,
did Lacedæmon, whose women are taught to vie with
men in courage, prove that virtue is superior to Fortune.
A few days afterwards, those who were watching the
body of Kleomenes as it hung upon the gibbet, observed a
large snake which wound its body round his head and
covered his face, so that no ravenous bird could alight
upon it. On hearing this, the king was struck with
superstitious terror, fearing that he had offended the gods
by the murder of one who was evidently a favourite of
Heaven, and something more than mortal. All the ladies
of his court began to offer sacrifices of atonement for his
sin, and the people of Alexandria went to the place and
worshipped Kleomenes as a hero and child of the gods,
until they were restrained by the learned, who explained
that as from the corrupted bodies of oxen are bred bees,
from horses wasps, and from asses beetles, so human
bodies, by the melting and gathering together of the
juices of the marrow, produce serpents. This was observed
by the ancients, who therefore considered that of all
animals the serpent was peculiarly appropriated to
heroes.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF TIBERIUS GRACCHUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="c1"></a> Having finished the first History,<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_20">20</a> it remains to contemplate
equal calamities in the pair of Roman Lives, in
a comparison of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus with Agis
and Kleomenes.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">21</a> Tiberius and Caius were the sons of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Tiberius Gracchus,<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">22</a> who was censor and twice consul,
and celebrated two triumphs, but was still more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
distinguished for his personal character, to which he owed the
honour of having for his wife Cornelia, the daughter of
Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">23</a> the conqueror of Hannibal, whom he married
after Scipio’s death, though Tiberius had not been a
friend of Scipio, but rather a political opponent. A story
is told that Tiberius once caught a couple of snakes<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">24</a> in
his bed, and the diviners, after consulting on the matter,
told him that he must not kill both nor yet let both go;
as to the male, they said, if it were killed, the death
of Tiberius would follow, and if the female were killed,
Cornelia would die. Now Tiberius, who loved his wife
and thought it would be more suitable for him to die first,
as he was an elderly man and his wife was still young,
killed the male snake and let the female go; and he died
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>no long time after, leaving twelve children by Cornelia,
Cornelia undertook the care of her family and her husband’s
property, and showed herself so prudent, so fond
of her children, and of so exalted a character, that Tiberius
was judged to have done well in dying in place of such a
wife. And though Ptolemæus,<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">25</a> the king of Egypt, invited
Cornelia to share his crown, and wooed her for his
wife, she refused the offer and continued a widow. All
her children died before her, except one daughter, who
married the younger Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">26</a> and two sons, of whom I am
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>going to speak, Tiberius and Caius, who were brought up
by their mother so carefully that they became, beyond
dispute, the most accomplished of all the Roman youth,
which they owed, perhaps, more to their excellent education
than even to their natural good qualities.</p>
<p>II.<a id="c2"></a> Now as the figures of the Dioscuri,<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">27</a> whether sculptured
or painted, though resembling one another, still
present such an amount of difference as appears when
we contrast a boxer with a runner, so in these two youths,
with all their resemblance in courage, temperance,
generous temper, eloquence, and magnanimity, yet great
contrasts also in their actions and polity blossomed forth,
so to speak, and displayed themselves, which I think it
well to set forth. First in the character and expression
of his countenance, and in his movements, Tiberius was
mild and sedate; Caius was animated and impetuous.
When Tiberius harangued the people, he would stand
composedly on one spot; but Caius was the first Roman
who moved about on the rostra<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">28</a> and pulled his toga
from his shoulder while he was speaking, as Kleon<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">29</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Athenian is said to have been the first popular orator at
Athens who threw his cloak from him and struck his
thigh. The manner of Caius was awe-striking and
vehemently impassioned; the manner of Tiberius was
more pleasing and calculated to stir the sympathies: the
language of Tiberius was pure and elaborated to great
nicety; that of Caius was persuasive and exuberant. In
like manner, in his mode of life and his table, Tiberius
was frugal and simple; compared with others, Caius was
moderate and austere, but, contrasted with his brother,
luxurious and curious, as we see by Drusus charging him
with buying silver dolphins<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">30</a> at the price of twelve hundred
and fifty drachmæ for every pound that they weighed.
The differences in their character corresponded to their
respective styles of speaking: Tiberius was moderate and
mild; Caius was rough and impetuous, and it often happened
that in his harangues he was carried away by
passion, contrary to his judgment, and his voice became
shrill, and he fell to abuse, and grew confused in his discourse.
To remedy this fault, he employed Licinius, a
well-educated slave, who used to stand behind him when
he was speaking, with a musical instrument,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_31">31</a> such as is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>used as an accompaniment to singing, and whenever he
observed that the voice of Caius was becoming harsh and
broken through passion, he would produce a soft note,
upon which Caius would immediately moderate his
vehemence and his voice, and become calm.</p>
<p>III.<a id="c3"></a> Such were the contrasts between the two brothers,
but in courage against the enemy, in justice to the subject
nations, in vigilance in the discharge of public duties,
and in self-control over indulgence, they were both alike.
Tiberius was the elder by nine years, a circumstance
which caused their political career to be separated by an
interval, and greatly contributed to the failure of their
measures, for they did not rise to eminence at the same
time nor unite their strength in one effort, which from their
union, would have been powerful and irresistible. I must
accordingly speak of each separately, and of the elder first.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="c4"></a> Immediately on attaining man’s estate, Tiberius
had so great a reputation that he was elected a member
of the college of augurs,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_32">32</a> rather for his excellent
qualities than his noble birth. Appius Claudius,<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_33">33</a> a man
of consular and censorian rank, who in consideration of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>his dignity was appointed Princeps Senatus,<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">34</a> and in
loftiness of character surpassed all his contemporaries,
showed his opinion of Tiberius; for when the augurs were
feasting together, Appius addressed Tiberius with many
expressions of friendship, and solicited him to take his
daughter to wife. Tiberius gladly accepted the proposal,
and the agreement was forthwith made. As Appius was
entering the door on his return home, he called out to his
wife in a loud voice, “Antistia, I have given our daughter
Claudia to wife.” Antistia in surprise replied, “What is
the need or the hurry, unless you have got Tiberius Gracchus
for her husband?” I am aware that some writers
tell this story of Tiberius the father of the Gracchi and of
Scipio Africanus; but the majority have the story as I
give it, and Polybius<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">35</a> says that after the death of Scipio
Africanus, his kinsmen selected Tiberius to be the husband
of Cornelia, and that she had neither been given in
marriage nor betrothed by her father in his lifetime.
Now the younger Tiberius served in the army in Africa<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_36">36</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>with the second Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_37">37</a> who had married his sister, and
by living in the general’s tent he soon learned his character,
which exhibited many and great qualities for virtuous
emulation and practical imitation. Tiberius, also, soon
surpassed all the young soldiers in attention to discipline
and in courage; and he was the first to mount the enemy’s
wall, as Fannius<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_38">38</a> says, who also asserts that he mounted
the wall with Tiberius and shared the honour with him.
While he was in the army Tiberius won the affection of
all the soldiers, and was regretted when he went away.</p>
<p>V.<a id="c5"></a> After that expedition he was elected quæstor,<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_39">39</a> and
it fell to his lot to serve in that capacity under the consul
Caius Mancinus,<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">40</a> no bad man, but the most unlucky of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Roman generals. Accordingly in adverse fortune and
critical affairs the prudence and courage of Tiberius
became the more conspicuous, and not only his prudence
and courage, but what was truly admirable, his consideration
and respect for his general, whose reverses almost
made him forget who he was. Having been defeated in
several great battles, Mancinus attempted to leave his
camp by night and make a retreat. The Numantines,
however, perceived his movements, and immediately
seizing the camp, fell on the Romans in their flight and
killed those in the rear; and at last, when they were
surrounding the whole army and driving them to unfavourable
ground, from which escape was impossible,
Mancinus, despairing of all chance of saving himself by
resistance, sent to treat for a truce and terms of peace.
But the Numantines declared that they would trust
nobody except Tiberius, and they bade Mancinus send
him. The Numantines had come to this resolution as well
from a knowledge of the young man’s character, for there
was much talk about him in this campaign, as from the
remembrance of his father Tiberius, who, after carrying
on war against the Iberians and subduing many of them,
made peace with the Numantines, and always kept the
Roman people to a fair and just observance of it. Accordingly
Tiberius was sent, and had a conference with the
Numantines, in which he got some favourable conditions,
and, by making some concessions, obtained a truce, and
thus saved twenty thousand Roman citizens, besides the
slaves and camp-followers.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="c6"></a>. All the property that was taken in the camp became
the booty of the Numantines; and among it were
the tablets of Tiberius, which contained the entries and
accounts of his administration as quæstor. Being very
anxious to recover them, though the army had already
advanced some distance, he returned to the city with
three or four companions, and calling forth the magistrates
of Numantia, he begged to have back his tablets, in order
that his enemies might not have an opportunity of calumniating
him if he should not be able to give an account
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>of his administration of the public money. The Numantines
were pleased at the opportunity of doing him a
service, and invited him to enter the city; and when he
stood hesitating, they came near and clung to his hands,
and were urgent in entreating him not to consider them
as enemies any longer, but as friends, and to trust them.
Tiberius determined to do so, as he was very anxious to
get the tablets, and feared to irritate the Numantines if
he should seem to distrust them. When he had entered
the city, the first thing they did was to prepare an entertainment,
and to urge him most importunately to sit
down and eat with them. They afterwards gave him
back the tablets, and bade him take anything else he
liked. Tiberius, however, would have nothing except the
frankincense which he wanted for the public sacrifices,
and after a friendly embrace he took his leave of them.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="c7"></a> On his return to Rome, the whole transaction was
greatly blamed as dishonourable and disgraceful to Rome.
The kinsfolk and friends of the soldiers, who were a
large part of the people, crowded about Tiberius, charging
the general with the disgraceful part of what had happened,
and declaring that Tiberius had been the saviour
of so many citizens. Those who were the most vexed at
the events in Iberia,<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41_41">41</a> recommended that they should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>follow the example of their ancestors; for in former times
the Romans stripped of their clothes and delivered up to
the Samnites<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">42</a> those who had purchased their safety on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>dishonourable terms, both the generals and all who had any
share or participation in the treaty, quæstors and tribunes
all alike, and on their heads they turned the violation of the
oaths and the infraction of the agreement. It was on this
occasion particularly, that the people showed their affection
and zeal towards Tiberius: for they decided to deliver
up the consul, stripped and in chains, to the Numantines,
but they spared all the rest on account of Tiberius. It
appears that Scipio also, who was then the most powerful
man in Rome, gave his assistance in this matter, but nevertheless
he was blamed for not saving Mancinus, and not
making any exertion to ratify the treaty with the Numantines,
which had been concluded by his relation and friend
Tiberius. But whatever difference there was between Scipio
and Tiberius on this occasion, perhaps originated mainly
in jealousy and was owing to the friends of Tiberius and
the sophists, who endeavoured to prejudice him against
Scipio. There was, however, no irreconcilable breach made
between them, and no bad result from this affair; indeed,
it seems to me that Tiberius would never have been involved
in those political measures which cost him his
life, if Scipio Africanus had been at Rome while they
were going on. But it was while Scipio was carrying on
the war at Numantia<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_43">43</a> that Tiberius commenced his legislation,
to which he was led from the following motives.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="c8"></a> Whatever territory the Romans acquired from
their neighbours in war, they sold part, and retaining
the other part as public property,<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_44">44</a> they gave it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>poorer citizens to cultivate, on the payment of a small
sum to the treasury. But as the rich began to outbid the
poor, and so to drive them out, a law was passed which
forbade any one to have more than five hundred jugera
of land. This law restrained the greediness of the rich for a
short time, and was a relief to the poor, who remained on
the land which they had hired, and cultivated the several
portions which they originally had. But in course of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>time their rich neighbours contrived to transfer the
holdings to themselves in the names of other persons, and
at last openly got possession of the greater part of the
public lands in their own names, and the poor, being
expelled, were not willing to take military service and
were careless about bringing up families, in consequence
of which there was speedily a diminution in the number
of freemen all through Italy, and the country was filled
with ergastula<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">45</a> of barbarian slaves, with whom the rich
cultivated the lands from which they had expelled the
citizens. Now Caius Lælius,<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46_46">46</a> the friend of Scipio, attempted
to remedy this mischief, but he desisted through fear
of the disturbances that were threatened by the opposition
of the rich, whence he got the name of wise or prudent,
for such is the signification of the Roman word “sapiens.”
Tiberius, on being elected tribune,<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">47</a> immediately undertook
the same measures, as most say, at the instigation of the
orator Diophanes and the philosopher Blossius.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">48</a> Diophanes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>was an exile from Mitylene: Blossius was an Italian from
Cumæ, and had been an intimate at Rome with Antipater
of Tarsus, who had done him the honour of dedicating to
him some of his philosophical writings. Some give part of
the blame to Cornelia also, the mother of Tiberius, who
frequently reproached her sons that the Romans still
called her the mother-in-law of Scipio, but not yet the
mother of the Gracchi. Others say that jealousy of one
Spurius Postumius,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">49</a> a contemporary of Tiberius, and a
rival of his reputation as an orator, was the immediate
motive: for it is said that when Tiberius returned to
Rome from his military service, he found that Postumius
had far out-stripped him in reputation and influence, and
seeing the distinction that Postumius had attained, he
determined to get the advantage over him by engaging in
measures which were attended with hazard, but promised
great results. But his brother Caius in a certain book has
recorded, that as Tiberius was passing through Tyrrhenia
(Tuscany), on his road to Numantia, he observed the deserted
state of the country, and that the cultivators and
shepherds were foreign slaves and barbarians; and that he
then for the first time conceived those political measures
which to them were the beginning of infinite calamities.
But the energy and ambition of Tiberius were mainly excited
by the people, who urged him by writing on the
porticoes, the walls, and on the tombs, to recover the public
land for the poor.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="c9"></a> He did not, however, draw up the law without
assistance, but took the advice of the citizens most eminent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>for character and reputation, among whom were Crassus<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">50</a>
the pontifex maximus, Mucius Scævola,<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">51</a> the jurist, who
was then consul, and Claudius Appius, his father-in-law.
Never was a measure directed against such wrong and
aggression conceived in more moderate and gentle terms;
for though the rich well deserved to be punished for their
violation of law and to be compelled to surrender under
penalties the land which they had been illegally enjoying,
the law merely declared that they should give up their
unjust acquisitions upon being paid the value of them,
and should allow the lands to be occupied by the citizens
who were in want of this relief. Though the reform of
this abuse was so moderate and reasonable, the people
were satisfied to take no notice of the past and to secure
themselves against wrong for the future. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>rich and those who had possessions detested the proposed
law because of their greediness, and the proposer of it was
the object of their indignation and jealousy; and accordingly
they attempted to divert the people from the
measure, by insinuating that Tiberius was proposing a
division of land merely to disturb the state and to bring
about a revolution. But they failed altogether; for
Tiberius, supporting a measure in itself honourable and
just, with an eloquence<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52_52">52</a> calculated to set off even a meaner
subject, showed his power and his superiority over his
opponents, whenever the people were crowded round the
rostra and he addressed them about the poor. “The
wild beasts of Italy,” he would say, “had their dens and
holes and hiding-places, while the men who fought and
died in defence of Italy enjoyed, indeed, the air and the
light, but nothing else: houseless and without a spot of
ground to rest upon, they wander about with their wives
and children, while their commanders, with a lie in their
mouth, exhort the soldiers in battle to defend their tombs
and temples against the enemy, for out of so many
Romans not one has a family altar or ancestral tomb, but
they fight to maintain the luxury and wealth of others,
and they die with the title of lords of the earth,<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">53</a> without
possessing a single clod to call their own.”</p>
<p>X.<a id="c10"></a> Such language as this, proceeding from a lofty
spirit and genuine feeling, and delivered to the people,
who were vehemently excited and roused, none of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>enemies of Tiberius attempted to refute. Abandoning,
therefore, all idea of opposing him by words, they
addressed themselves to Marcus Octavius,<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">54</a> one of the
tribunes, a young man of sober and orderly disposition,
and a companion and friend of Tiberius. At first Octavius,
from regard to Tiberius, evaded the proposals, but being
urged and importuned by many of the powerful nobles,<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">55</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>and as it were, driven to it, he set himself in opposition
to Tiberius, and prevented the passing of the law. Now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>all the power is virtually in the hands of the dissentient
tribune, for the rest can do nothing if a single tribune
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>oppose them. Irritated at this, Tiberius withdrew his
moderate measure and introduced another, more agreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>to the people and more severe against the illegal possessors
of land; this new measure ejected persons out of the
lands which they had got possession of contrary to existing
laws. There was a daily contest between him and
Octavius at the rostra, but though they opposed one
another with great earnestness and rivalry, it is said they
never uttered a disparaging word against one another,
and that no unbecoming expression ever escaped either of
them against the other. It is not, then, in bacchanalian
revelries<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56_56">56</a> only, as it seems, but also in ambitious rivalry
and passion, that to be of noble nature and to have been
well brought up, restrains and governs the mind. Tiberius,
observing that Octavius himself was obnoxious to the law
and possessed a considerable tract of the public land,
begged him to desist from his opposition, offering to pay
him the value of the land out of his own purse, though
he was by no means in affluent circumstances. Upon
Octavius rejecting the proposal, Tiberius by an edict
forbade all the other magistrates to transact any public
business until the people had voted upon his law; and
he placed his private seals on the temple of Saturn,<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">57</a> that
the quæstors might not be able to take anything out of it
or pay anything in, and he gave public notice that a
penalty would be imposed on the prætors if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
disobeyed; in consequence of which all the magistrates were
afraid and ceased from discharging their several functions.
Upon this the possessors changed their dress and went
about the Forum in a piteous and humble guise, but
in secret they plotted against Tiberius and endeavoured
to procure assassins to take him off; in consequence of
which, Tiberius, as everybody knew, wore under his dress
a short sword, such as robbers use, which the Romans call
dolo.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58_58">58</a></p>
<p>XI.<a id="c11"></a> When the day came and Tiberius was calling the
people to the vote, the voting-urns<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59_59">59</a> were seized by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>rich and the proceedings were put into great confusion.
However, as the partisans of Tiberius, who had the superiority
in numbers, were collecting in order to make
resistance, Manlius<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60_60">60</a> and Fulvius, both consular men,
falling down at the knees of Tiberius, and clinging to his
hands with tears, begged him to desist. Tiberius, seeing
that matters were near coming to extremities, and from
regard to the men also, asked them what they would have
him do; to which they replied, that they were not competent
to advise on so important a matter, and they
urged him to refer it to the senate, and at last he
consented. The senate met, but did nothing, owing to
the opposition of the rich, who had great influence in the
body; upon which Tiberius had recourse to the unconstitutional
and violent measure of depriving Octavius
of his office, finding it impossible to put his proposed
law to the vote in any other way. In the first place,
he publicly entreated Octavius, addressing him affectionately
and clinging to his hands, to yield to and gratify
the people, who asked for nothing but their rights, and
would only get a small matter in return for great dangers
and sufferings. Octavius rejected this proposition; upon
which Tiberius reminded him that both of them were
magistrates and were contending with equal power on
a weighty matter, and that it was not possible for this
struggle to continue without coming to open hostility;
that he saw no remedy except for one of them to give
up his office; and he bade Octavius put it to the people
to vote on his case first, and said that he would immediately
descend to the station of a private man, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>citizens should desire it. As Octavius refused this proposal
also, Tiberius said that he would put the question
about Octavius retiring from the tribunate to the people,
if Octavius did not change his resolution.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="c12"></a> Thus ended the assembly of that day. On the
following day Tiberius mounted the rostra and again
endeavoured to persuade Octavius; but as he would
not yield, Tiberius proposed a law by which Octavius
should be deprived of his tribunate, and he forthwith summoned
the citizens to vote upon it. Now, there were
five and thirty tribes,<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61_61">61</a> and when seventeen of them
had already given their vote, and the addition of one more
tribe would reduce Octavius to a private condition,
Tiberius stopped the voting, and again entreated Octavius,
embracing him in the presence of the people and urgently
praying him not to be careless about being deprived
of his office, and not to bring on him the blame of so
severe and odious a measure. It is said that Octavius
was not entirely untouched or unmoved by these entreaties,
and his eyes were filled with tears and he was
silent for some time. But when he looked to the rich and
the possessors, who were standing together in one body,
through fear of losing their good opinion, as it seems,
he boldly determined to run every risk, and he told
Tiberius to do what he pleased. Accordingly the law
was passed, and Tiberius ordered one of his freedmen
to drag Octavius from the rostra, for Tiberius employed
his own freedmen as officers; a circumstance which made
the spectacle of Octavius dragged from the rostra with
contumely still more deplorable. At the same time the
people made an assault on Octavius, and though the rich
all ran to his assistance and disengaged him from their
hands, it was not without difficulty that he was rescued
and made his escape from the mob. But one of his faithful
slaves, who had placed himself in front of his master
to defend him, had his eyes torn out. This violence was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>quite contrary to the wishes of Tiberius, who, on seeing
what was going on, speedily made his way to the disturbance.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="c13"></a> The law about the land was now immediately
carried, and triumviri<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62_62">62</a> were appointed for ascertaining
its bounds and distributing it; the triumviri were
Tiberius, and his father-in-law Claudius Appius, and
Caius Gracchus, his brother, who, however, was not at
Rome, but serving under Scipio against Numantia. All
this Tiberius accomplished quietly without any opposition,
and he also procured to be elected tribune in the room of
Octavius, not a person of rank, but one Mucius<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63_63">63</a> a client<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64_64">64</a>
of his own. The nobles, who were vexed at all these
measures and feared the growing power of Tiberius,
treated him in the senate with contumely; and upon his
asking, according to custom, for a tent from the treasury
for his use while he was distributing the land, they
refused it to him, though others had often had one
allowed them on less important occasions; and they only
gave him for his expenses nine oboli<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65_65">65</a> a day, which was
done on the motion of Publius Nasica,<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66_66">66</a> who entered
violently into the opposition against Tiberius, for he was
in possession of a very large amount of public land, and
was greatly annoyed at being forcibly ejected from it.
But the people now became still more violent. A
friend of Tiberius happened to die suddenly, and suspicious
marks immediately showed themselves on the
body. The people cried out that he was poisoned, and
collecting in great numbers at the funeral, they carried the
bier and stood by while the body was burnt. And the
suspicion of poison appeared to have some reason, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>body burst on the pile and sent forth such a quantity of
corrupt humours as to quench the flame; and though a
light was again applied, the body would not burn till it
was removed to another place, where, after much trouble,
the fire at last laid hold of it. Upon this Tiberius, with
the view of exciting the people still more, changed his dress,
and showing his children to the people, begged that they
would protect them and their mother, for he now despaired
of his own safety.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="c14"></a> On the death of Attalus<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67_67">67</a> Philometor, Eudemus of
Pergamum brought his will to Rome, in which the Roman
people were made the king’s heir. In order to please the
people, Tiberius promulgated a law to the effect that as
soon as the king’s treasures were received, they should be
distributed among those who had assignments of land,
in order to enable them to stock the farms and to assist
them in their cultivation. With respect to the cities
included within the kingdom of Attalus, he said that the
senate had no right to decide about them, but he would
bring the subject before the popular assembly. This
measure gave violent offence to the senate, and Pompeius<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68_68">68</a>
getting up, said that he lived near Tiberius, and so knew
that Eudemus of Pergamum had given a diadem out of the
royal treasures and a purple robe to Tiberius, who
designed to make himself king in Rome. Quintus
Metellus<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69_69">69</a> reproached Tiberius by reminding him, that
whenever his father, during his censorship, was returning
home from supper, the citizens used to put out the lights
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>for fear it might be supposed that they were indulging
too much in entertainments and drinking, but that the
most insolent and needy of the citizens accompanied
Tiberius with lights at night. Titus Annius,<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70_70">70</a> who was
not a man of good repute or sober behaviour, but in any
contest of words by way of question and answer was considered
to be unequalled, challenged Tiberius to answer
definitely whether he had or had not branded with infamy
his brother tribune, though by the law he was sacred and
inviolable. As the question was received with signs of
approbation, Tiberius, hastily quitting the senate-house,
convoked the people and ordered Annius to be brought
before them, with the intention of accusing him. But
Annius, who was much inferior to Tiberius both in
eloquence and reputation, had recourse to his tricks, and
called on Tiberius to answer a few questions before he
began his speech. Tiberius assented, and as soon as there
was silence, Annius said, “If you intend to deprive me
of my rank, and disgrace me, and I appeal to one of
your brother tribunes, and he shall come to my aid,
and you shall then fall into a passion, will you deprive
him of his office?” On this question being put, it
is said that Tiberius, though no man was readier in
words or bolder in action, was so confused that he made
no reply.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="c15"></a> For the present Tiberius<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71_71">71</a> dissolved the assembly,
seeing that his proceedings with respect to Octavius were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>not liked either by the nobles or the people, for they
considered that the high and honourable dignity of the
tribunate, which had been kept unimpaired up to that
time, had been destroyed and trampled upon. He made
an harangue to the people, a few of the arguments of
which it will not be out of place to mention, for the
purpose of showing the persuasive eloquence and the
subtlety of the man. He said that a tribune was sacred
and inviolate, only because he was dedicated to the people
and was the guardian of the people. If then a tribune
should deviate from his duty and wrong the people,
abridge their power and deprive them of the opportunity
of voting, he had by his own act deprived himself of his
rank, by not fulfilling the conditions on which he
received it. Now we must consider a tribune to be still a
tribune, though he should dig down the Capitol and burn
the naval arsenal. If he should commit such excesses
as these, he is a bad tribune; but if he should attempt to
deprive the people of their power, he is not a tribune at
all. And is it not a monstrous thing if a tribune shall
have power to order a consul to be put in prison, and the
people shall not be able to deprive a tribune of his power
when he is using it against the people who gave it to
him? for both tribune and consul are equally chosen
by the people. Now the kingly office, besides comprehending
within it all civil power, is consecrated to the
divinity by the discharge of the chief ceremonials of religion;
and yet the state ejected Tarquinius for his wrong-doing,
and for the violence of one man the ancient power
which established Rome was overthrown. And what is
there at Rome so sacred, so venerated as the virgins who
guard the ever-burning fire? but if any of them offends,
she is buried alive; for when they sin against the gods,
they no longer retain that inviolable sanctity which they
have by being devoted to the gods. In like manner,
neither has a tribune when he is wronging the people any
right to retain the inviolable character which he receives
from the people, for he is destroying the very power
which is the origin of his own power. And indeed, if he
has legally received the tribunitian power by the votes of a
majority of the tribes, how is it that he cannot even <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>still
more legally be deposed by the vote of all the tribes? Now,
nothing is so sacred and inviolable as things dedicated to
the gods; but yet no one has ever hindered the people
from using such things, moving them, and changing their
places as they please. It is therefore legal for the
people to transfer the tribunate, as a consecrated thing,
from one man to another. And that the tribunate is
not an inviolable thing, nor an office of which a man
cannot be divested, is clear from this that many magistrates
have abdicated their office and prayed to be excused
from it of their own free will.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="c16"></a> Such were the heads of the justification of
Tiberius. His friends, seeing the threats of his enemies
and their combination, thought that he ought to be a
candidate for the tribunate for the next year; and
Tiberius attempted to strengthen his popularity by
promising to carry new measures,<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72_72">72</a> such as a diminution
of the period of military service, an appeal to the people
from the judices, an intermixture of an equal number of
the Equites with the Senators, from whom alone the
judices were then taken; and in every way he attempted
to abridge the power of the Senate, influenced rather
by passion and ambition, than justice and the interests of
the state. While the voting was going on, the friends of
Tiberius, seeing that their enemies were gaining the
advantage, for all the people were not present,<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73_73">73</a> at first
attempted to prolong the time by abusing the other tribunes,
and next they dissolved the meeting and appointed
it for the following day. Tiberius, going down to the
Forum, supplicated the citizens in humble manner and
with tears in his eyes; he then said that he feared his
enemies would break into his house by night and kill him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>and thus he induced a great number of the citizens to take
their station about his house and watch there all night.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="c17"></a> At daybreak the man came to bring the birds
which the Romans use in their auspices, and he threw them
food. But the birds would not come out of the basket<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74_74">74</a>
with the exception of one, though the man shook it hard;
and even this one would not touch the food, but after
raising its left wing and stretching out a leg it ran back
to the basket. This reminded Tiberius of another omen
that had happened. He had a helmet which he wore in
battle, elaborately worked and splendid. Some snakes
had got into the helmet unobserved, and laid their eggs
and hatched them there. This made Tiberius still more
uneasy about the signs from the fowls. Nevertheless
he advanced up the city on hearing that the people was
assembled about the Capitol; but before he got out of
the house he stumbled over the threshold, and the blow
was so violent that the nail of his great toe was broken,
and the blood ran out through his shoe. He had not got
far before some crows were seen fighting on the roof of
a house on the left hand, and though a great crowd was
passing by, as was natural on such an occasion, a stone
which was pushed off by one of the crows fell by the
feet of Tiberius. This made even the boldest of his
adherents hesitate; but Blossius of Cumæ, who was
present, said it would be a shame and a great disgrace if
Tiberius, a son of Gracchus and a grandson of Scipio
Africanus, and a defender of the Roman people should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>not obey the summons of the people for fear of a crow,
and that his enemies would not treat this cowardly act
as a matter of ridicule, but would make it the ground of
calumniating him to the people as playing the tyrant and
treating them with contempt. At the same time many
persons ran up to Tiberius with a message from his friends
in the Capitol, to hasten there, as all was going on
favourably. And indeed everything promised well at
first, for as soon as he appeared he was greeted with
friendly cheers, and as he ascended the Capitol he was
joyfully received, and the people crowded about him to
prevent any stranger from approaching.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="c18"></a> Now, Mucius began to summon the tribes again,
but nothing could be conducted with the usual forms on
account of the confusion that prevailed among those who
were on the outskirts of the assembly, where they were
struggling with their opponents, who were attempting
to force their way in and mingle with the rest. At this
juncture Flavius Flaccus,<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75_75">75</a> a senator, posted himself in a
conspicuous place, and as it was not possible to make
his voice heard so far, he made a signal with his hand
that he wished to say something in private to Tiberius.
Tiberius bade the crowd let Flaccus pass, who, with
great difficulty making his way up to Tiberius, told him
that the Senate was sitting, that as they could not prevail
on the consul, the rich were resolving to kill Tiberius
themselves, and that they had armed many of their slaves
and friends for this purpose.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="c19"></a> Upon Tiberius reporting this to those who were
standing about him, they forthwith tucked up their
dress, and breaking the staves which the officers use to
keep the crowd back, distributed the fragments among
them and made ready to defend themselves against their
assailants. While those at a distance were wondering at
what was going on, and asking what it meant, Tiberius
touched his head with his hand, since his voice could not
be heard, intending thereby to signify to the people that
his life was in danger. His enemies on seeing this ran to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>the Senate and told them that Tiberius was asking
for a crown, and that his touching his head was a proof of
it. On this the whole body was greatly disturbed; Nasica
entreated the consul<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76_76">76</a> to protect the state and put down
the tyrant. The consul however answered mildly that he
would not be the first to use violence, and that he would
not take any citizen’s life without a regular trial; if however,
he said, the people should come to an illegal vote at the
instigation of Tiberius, or from compulsion, he would not
respect any such decision. Upon this Nasica springing up
exclaimed, “Well then, as the consul betrays the state, do
you who wish to maintain the laws follow me.” As he
uttered these words he drew the skirt of his dress over his
head, and hastened to the Capitol; and the senators who
followed him, wrapping their dress about them with one
hand, pushed all the people they met out of the way, no one
opposing them, from respect to their rank, but taking to
flight and trampling down one another. The followers
of the senators had clubs and sticks which they had
brought from home; but the senators seizing the fragments
and legs of the benches which were broken by the people
in their hurry to escape, made right to Tiberius, and
struck all those who were in their road. The people
were all put to flight or killed. As Tiberius was attempting
to make his escape, some one laid hold of his dress,
on which he dropped his toga and fled in his tunic; but
he stumbled over some persons who were lying on the
ground and was thrown down. While he was endeavouring
to rise, he received the first blow, as it is universally
admitted, from Publius Satyreius, one of his colleagues,
who struck him on the head with the leg of a bench.
Lucius Rufus claimed the credit of giving him the second
blow, as if that were a thing to be proud of. Above three
hundred persons lost their lives by sticks and stones, but
none by the sword.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>
<p>XX.<a id="c20"></a> This is said to have been the first disturbance at
Rome since the abolition of the kingly power, which
ended in bloodshed and the death of citizens. All
previous disputes, though they were neither trifling nor
about trifling matters, were settled by mutual concession:
the nobles yielded through fear of the people, and the
people yielded from respect to the Senate. Even on this
occasion it is probable that Tiberius would have given
way to persuasion without any difficulty, and still more
readily if his assailants had not come to bloodshed and
blows, for those about him were not above three thousand
in number. But the combination against him seems to
have proceeded rather from the passion and hatred of the
rich citizens, than from the reasons which they alleged;
and the brutal and indecent treatment of his dead body is
a proof of this. For they would not listen to his brother’s
request<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77_77">77</a> to take up the body and bury it at night, but it
was thrown into the Tiber with the other bodies. And
this was not all; they banished some of his friends without
trial, and others they seized and put to death, among
whom was Diophanes the orator. One Caius Villius<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78_78">78</a>
they shut up in a vessel with snakes and vipers, and thus
he died. Blossius of Cumæ, being brought before the
consuls and questioned about what had passed, admitted
that he had done everything at the bidding of Tiberius.
On Nasica asking<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">79</a> him, “What if Tiberius had told you
to burn the Capitol?” Blossius said, that Tiberius would
never have given him any such order. The same question
being often put to him, and by several persons, he said, “If
he had commanded me to burn the Capitol, it would have
been a good deed for me to do; for Tiberius would not
have given such an order unless it were for the interest of
the people.” Blossius, however, was set at liberty, and
afterwards went to Aristonikus<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80_80">80</a> in Asia, on the ruin of
whose affairs he killed himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>
<p>XXI.<a id="c21"></a> The Senate, under present circumstances, endeavoured
to soothe the people; they made no opposition to
the distribution of the public land, and they allowed the
people to elect another commissioner in place of Tiberius.
Having come to a vote, they elected Publius Crassus<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81_81">81</a> a
relation of Gracchus, for his daughter Licinia was the wife
of Caius Gracchus. Cornelius Nepos,<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82_82">82</a> indeed, says that
Caius did not marry the daughter of Crassus, but the
daughter of Brutus<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_83_83">83</a> who triumphed over the Lusitanians:
however, the majority of writers state the matter as I have
done. Now, as the people were sore about the death of
Tiberius, and were manifestly waiting for an opportunity
to be revenged, and Nasica<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84_84">84</a> was threatened with prosecutions,
the Senate, fearing for his safety, made a decree for
sending him to Asia, though they had nothing for him to do
there. For when men met Nasica they did not conceal their
hostility, but broke out into violence, and abused him
wherever they fell in with him, calling him accursed, and
tyrant, who had stained with the blood of an inviolable
and sacred functionary the most sacred and revered of all
the holy places in the city. Accordingly, Nasica left Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>though bound by the most sacred functions, for he was
Pontifex Maximus; and, rambling about despised from
place to place, he died no long time after in the neighbourhood
of Pergamum. It is no wonder if Nasica was so
much hated by the people, when even Scipio Africanus,
whom the Romans considered inferior to no man in
integrity, and loved as well as any, narrowly escaped
losing the popular favour, because, on receiving the news
of the death of Tiberius, at Numantia, he exclaimed in the
verse of Homer,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">So perish<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85_85">85</a> all who do the like again.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Subsequently, when Caius and Fulvius asked him, before
an assembly of the people, what he thought of the death
of Tiberius, he showed by his answer that he was not
pleased with the measures of Tiberius. This made the
people interrupt him with their shouts when he was
speaking, as they had never done before; and Scipio was so
far transported with passion as to break out into invectives
against them. But of this I have spoken more particularly
in the Life of Scipio.<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86_86">86</a></p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF CAIUS GRACCHUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="d1"></a> Caius Gracchus at first, either through fear of his
enemies or with the view of making them odious, withdrew
from the Forum<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87_87">87</a> and kept quiet at home, like a
man humbled for the present, and intending for the
future to keep aloof from public affairs; which gave
occasion for some people to say that he disliked the
measures of Tiberius, and had abandoned them. He was
also still quite a youth, for he was nine years younger
than his brother, and Tiberius was not thirty<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88_88">88</a> when he
was killed. But in the course of time, as his character
gradually displayed itself in his aversion to indolence,
luxury, wine, and all matters of private profit, and it was
clear, from his application to the study of eloquence, that
he was preparing, as it were, his pinions for public life,
and that he would not remain quiet; and further, when
he showed by his defence of Vettius, one of his friends,
who was under prosecution, the people all around him
being wild and frantic with delight, that the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>orators were mere children, the nobles were again alarmed,
and there was much talk among them that they would
not allow Caius to obtain the tribunate. It happened
without any set design that the lot fell on him to go as
quæstor to Sardinia,<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89_89">89</a> under Orestes<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90_90">90</a> the consul, which
pleased his enemies, and was not disagreeable to Caius.
For he was fond of war, and equally disciplined for
military service and speaking in the courts of justice;
but he still shrunk from public affairs and the Rostra,
and as he could not resist the invitations of the people
and his friends, he was well pleased with this opportunity
of leaving Rome. It is true it is a common opinion that
Caius was a pure demagogue, and much more greedy of
popular favour than Tiberius. But it was not so in fact,
and Caius seems to have been involved in public affairs
rather through a kind of necessity than choice. Cicero
the orator also says that Caius declined all offices, and
had determined to live in retirement, but that his brother
appeared to him in a dream,<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91_91">91</a> and said, “Caius, why do
you linger? There is no escape: one life for both of us,
and one death in defence of the people is our fate.”</p>
<p>II.<a id="d2"></a> Now, Caius during his stay in Sardinia exhibited his
excellent qualities in every way; he far surpassed all the
young men in military courage, in upright conduct to the
subject people, in loyalty and respect to the commander;
and in temperance, frugality, and attention to his duties
he excelled even his elders. The winter having been
severe and unhealthy in Sardinia, the general demanded
clothing for his soldiers from the cities, upon which they
sent to Rome to pray to be relieved from this imposition.
The Senate granted their petition, and ordered the general
to get supplies for the troops by other means; but as the
general was unable to do this, and the soldiers were suffering,
Caius went round to the cities and induced them
voluntarily to send clothing and to assist the Romans.
This, being reported to Rome, made the Senate uneasy, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>they viewed it as a preliminary to popular agitation.
Ambassadors also arrived at Rome from Libya, with a
message from King Micipsa,<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92_92">92</a> that the king had sent corn
to the commander in Sardinia, out of respect for Caius
Gracchus. The Senate, taking offence at the message,
would not receive the ambassadors, and they passed a
decree that fresh troops should be sent out to replace those
in Sardinia, but that Orestes should stay; intending by
this measure to keep Caius there also, in respect of his
office. On this being done, Caius immediately set sail in
a passion, and appearing at Rome contrary to all expectation,
was not only blamed by his enemies, but even the
people considered it a strange thing for the quæstor to
leave his general behind. However, when the matter was
brought before the Censors,<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93_93">93</a> he asked for permission to
make his defence, and he produced such a change in the
opinions of his audience, that he was acquitted, and considered
to have been exceedingly ill used: he said that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>had served in the army for twelve years, while others were
only required to serve ten years, and that he had exercised
the functions of quæstor to the commander for three years,
though the law allowed him to return after one year’s
service; he added that he was the only soldier who took
out a full purse with him and brought it back empty,
while the rest took out with them only jars of wine, which
they had emptied in Sardinia, and brought them back full
of gold and silver.</p>
<p>III.<a id="d3"></a> After this, his enemies brought fresh charges
against him, and harassed him with prosecutions on the
ground of causing the defection of the allies and having
participated in the conspiracy which had been detected at
Fregellæ.<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94_94">94</a> But he cleared himself of all suspicion, and
having established his innocence, immediately set about
canvassing for the tribunate. All the men of distinction,
without exception, opposed him; and so great a multitude
flocked to Rome from all parts of Italy, to the Comitia,
that many of them could not find lodgings, and the Campus
Martius<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95_95">95</a> being unable to contain the numbers, they
shouted from the house-tops and tilings. However, the
nobility so far prevailed against the people as to disappoint
the hopes of Caius, inasmuch as he was not returned first,
as he expected, but only fourth. But upon entering on
his office he soon made himself first, for he surpassed every
Roman in eloquence,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96_96">96</a> and his misfortunes gave him a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>licence for speaking freely when lamenting the fate of his
brother. He took every opportunity of directing the
thoughts of the people to this subject, reminding them of
former times, and contrasting the conduct of their
ancestors, who went to war with the Falisci on behalf of
Gemicius, a tribune, who had been insulted by them, and
condemned Caius Veturius to death because he was the
only man that did not make way for a tribune as he was
passing through the Forum. “But before your eyes,” he
exclaimed, “these men beat Tiberius to death with staves,
and his body was dragged through the midst of the city
to be thrown into the Tiber; and all his friends who
were caught were put to death without trial. And yet
it is an old usage among us, if a man is accused of a
capital charge and does not appear, for a trumpeter to come
to the door of his house in the morning and summon him
by the sound of the trumpet, and the judices cannot vote
upon the charge till this has been done. So circumspect
and careful were the Romans of old in the trials of persons
accused.”</p>
<p>IV.<a id="d4"></a> Having first stirred up the people by such harangues
as these (and he had a very loud voice, and was most
vigorous in speech), he promulgated two laws:<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97_97">97</a> one, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>effect that if the people had deprived any magistrate of
his office, he should be incapacitated from holding office a
second time; and the other, which rendered a magistrate
liable to a public prosecution if he had banished any
citizen without trial. One of these rogations had the
direct effect of branding with infamy Marcus Octavius,
who had been deprived of the tribunate by Tiberius; and
Popillius<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98_98">98</a> came within the penalties of the other, for
during his prætorship he had banished the friends of
Tiberius. Popillius did not stand his trial, and he fled
from Italy; but the other law Caius himself withdrew,
saying that he refrained from touching Octavius at the
request of his mother Cornelia. The people admired his
conduct on this occasion, and gave their consent, for they
respected Cornelia no less for the sake of her sons than her
father; and afterwards they set up a bronze statue<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99_99">99</a> of her,
with the inscription—Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi.
There are recorded several things that Caius said in
defence of his mother in a rhetorical and coarse way, in
reply to one of his enemies. “What,” said he, “do you
abuse Cornelia, the mother of Tiberius?” And as the
man laboured under the imputation of being a dissolute
fellow, he added, “How can you have the impudence to
compare yourself with Cornelia? Have you been a
mother, as she has?”—and more to the like effect, but
still coarser. Such was the bitterness of his language, and
many like things occur in his writings.</p>
<p>V.<a id="d5"></a> Of the laws<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100_100">100</a> which he promulgated with the view
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>of gaining the popular favour and weakening the Senate,
one was for the establishment of colonies and the distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of Public Land among the poor; another provided for
supplying the soldiers with clothing at the public expense,
without any deduction on this account being made from
their pay, and exempted youths under seventeen years of
age from being drafted for the army; a third was in
favour of the allies, and put the Italians on the same footing
as the citizens with respect to the suffrage; another
related to grain, and had for its object the lowering of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>price for the poor; the last related to the judices, a
measure which most of all encroached on the privileges of
the senate—for the senate alone supplied judices for the
trials, and this privilege rendered that body formidable
both to the people and the equites. The law of Gracchus
added three hundred equites to the senate, who were also
three hundred in number, and it made the judices eligible
out of the whole six hundred. In his endeavours to carry
this law he is said to have made every exertion; and in
particular it is recorded that all the popular leaders who
preceded him turned their faces to the senate and the
comitium while they were speaking, but he was the first
who turned his face the other way to the Forum while
haranguing the people, and he continued to do so; and by
a small deviation and alteration in attitude he stirred a
great question, and in a manner transformed the government
from an aristocratical to a democratical form, by this
new attitude intimating that the orators should direct
their speeches to the many and not to the senate.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="d6"></a> The people not only passed this law, but empowered
Gracchus to select from the equites those who were to act
as judices, which conferred on him a kind of monarchical
authority, and even the senate now assented to the
measures which he proposed in their body. But all the
measures which he proposed were honourable to the senate;
such, for instance, was the very equitable and just decree
about the grain which Fabius the proprætor sent from
Iberia. Gracchus induced the senate to sell the grain and
to return the money which it produced to the Iberian cities,
and further to censure Fabius for making the Roman
dominion heavy and intolerable to the subject nations; this
measure brought him great reputation and popularity in
the provinces. He also introduced measures for sending
out colonies, the construction of roads, and the building of
public granaries; and he made himself director and superintendent
for the carrying all these measures into effect.
Though engaged in so many great undertakings, he was
never wearied, but with wonderful activity and labour he
effected every single object as if he had for the time no
other occupation, so that even those who thoroughly hated
and feared him were struck with amazement at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>rapidity
and perfect execution of all that he undertook. But the
people looked with admiration on the man himself, seeing
him attended by crowds of building-contractors, artificers,
ambassadors, magistrates, soldiers, and learned men, to all
of whom he was easy of access; and while he maintained
his dignity, he was affable to all, and adapted his behaviour
to the condition of every individual, and so proved the
falsehood of those who called him tyrannical or arrogant or
violent. He thus showed himself more skilful as a popular
leader in his dealings with men, and in his conduct, than
in his harangues from the Rostra.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="d7"></a> But Caius busied himself most about the construction
of roads,<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101_101">101</a> having in view utility, convenience, and
ornament. The roads were made in a straight line, right
through the country, partly of quarried stone and partly
with tight-rammed masses of earth. By filling up the
depressions, and throwing bridges across those parts which
were traversed by winter torrents or deep ravines, and
raising the road on both sides to the same uniform height,
the whole line was made level and presented an agreeable
appearance. He also measured all the roads by miles (the
Roman mile is not quite eight Greek stadia), and fixed
stone blocks to mark the distances. He placed other stones
at less distances from one another on each side of the road,
that persons might thus easily mount their horses without
assistance.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="d8"></a> As the people extolled him for all these services,
and were ready to show their good will towards him in
any way, he said on one occasion when he was addressing
them, that he would ask a favour, which he would value
above everything if it was granted, but if it were refused,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>he should not complain. It was accordingly expected that
he would ask for the consulship, and everybody supposed
that he would be a candidate for the consulship and the tribunate
at the same time. When the consular comitia were
near, and all were at the highest point of expectation, Caius
appeared conducting Caius Fannius into the Campus
Martius, and canvassing with his friends for Fannius.<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102_102">102</a>
This gave Fannius a great advantage. Fannius was
elected consul, and Caius tribune for the second time,
though he was neither a candidate nor canvassed, but his
election was entirely due to the zeal of the people. Perceiving,
however, that the senate was clearly opposed to
him, and that the kind feeling of Fannius towards him
cooled, he forthwith endeavoured to attach the people by
other measures, by proposing to send colonies to Tarentum
and Capua, and by inviting the Latins to a participation
in the Roman franchise. The senate, fearing that Gracchus
would become irresistible, attempted a new and unusual
method of diverting the people from him, by opposing
popular measures to his, and by gratifying the people,
contrary to sound policy. Livius Drusus was one of the
colleagues of Caius, a man by birth and education inferior
to none in Rome, and in character, eloquence, and wealth
equal to any who enjoyed either honour or power by the
aid of these advantages. To him accordingly the chief
nobles applied, and they urged him to attack Caius, and
to unite with them against him, not by adopting violent
measures, nor coming into collision with the many, but by
a course of administration adapted to please, and by making
such concessions as it would have been honourable to refuse,
even at the risk of unpopularity.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="d9"></a> Livius, having agreed to employ his tribunitian
authority on the side of the senate, framed measures which
had neither any honourable nor any useful object: he only
had in view to outbid Caius in the popular favour, just as
it is in a comedy, by making himself busy and vying with
his rival. This showed most clearly that the senate were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>not displeased with the measures of Caius, but only wished
to destroy him or completely humble him. When Caius
proposed to send out ten colonies consisting of citizens of
the best character, the senate accused him of truckling to
the people; but they co-operated with Livius, who proposed
twelve colonies, each of which was to consist of
three thousand needy citizens. They set themselves in
opposition to Caius when he proposed to distribute land
among the poor, subject to a yearly payment to the
treasury from each, on the ground that he was trying to
gain the popular favour; but they were satisfied when
Livius proposed to relieve the colonists even from this
payment. Further, Caius gave them offence by proposing
to confer on the Latins the Roman suffrage; but when
Livius brought forward a measure which forbade any Latin
to be beaten with rods even while serving in the army,
they supported it. And indeed Livius himself, in his
harangues to the people, always said that he only proposed
what was agreeable to the senate, who had a regard for
the many; which indeed was the only good that resulted
from his measures. For the people became more pacifically
disposed towards the senate; and though the most
distinguished of them were formerly suspected and hated
by the people, Livius did away with and softened their
recollection of past grievances and their ill feeling, by
giving out that it was in accordance with the wish of the
senate that he had entered upon his popular career and
framed measures to please the many.</p>
<p>X.<a id="d10"></a> But the best proof to the people of the good intentions
and honesty of Livius was, that he proposed nothing for
himself or in behalf of his own interests; for he appointed
other persons to superintend the establishment of the
colonies, and he did not meddle with the administration of
the money, while Caius had assigned to himself most of
such functions, and the most important of them. It happened
that Rubrius, one of the tribunes, had proposed a
measure for the colonisation of Carthage, which had been
destroyed by Scipio; and as the lot fell on Caius, he set sail
to Libya to found the colony. In his absence, Drusus,
making still further advances, insinuated himself into the
favour of the people, and gained them over mainly <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>by
calumniating Fulvius.<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103_103">103</a> This Fulvius was a friend of
Caius and a joint commissioner for the distribution of
lands; but he was a noisy fellow, and specially disliked
by the senate; he was also suspected by others of stirring
up the allies, and secretly encouraging the Italians to
revolt; and though this was said without proof or inquiry,
Fulvius himself gave it credit by his unwise and revolutionary
policy. This more than anything else destroyed
the popularity of Caius, who came in for his share of the
odium against Fulvius. And when Scipio<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104_104">104</a> Africanus died
without any obvious cause, and certain signs of blows and
violence were supposed to be visible on the body, as I told
in the Life of Scipio, the suspicion fell chiefly on Fulvius,
who was his enemy, and on that day had abused Scipio
from the Rostra. Suspicion attached to Caius also.
So abominable a crime committed against the first and
greatest of the Romans went unpunished, and there was
not even an inquiry; for the many opposed it and stopped
the investigation through fear for Caius, lest he should be
discovered to be implicated in the murder. These events,
indeed, belong to an earlier period.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="d11"></a> In Libya, as to the foundation of Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105_105">105</a> which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Caius named Junonia, which is the same as Heraea, it is
said there were many supernatural hindrances. For the
first standard was seized and broken by a violent gust of
wind, though the standard-bearer stuck to it vigorously;
and the victims which were lying on the altars were dispersed
by a tempest, and scattered beyond the stakes
which marked the limits of the city, and the stakes were
torn up by the wolves and carried a long way off. However
Caius, after settling and arranging everything in
seventy days, returned to Rome upon hearing that Fulvius
was hard pressed by Drusus, and that affairs required his
presence. Lucius Opimius, a man who belonged to the
faction of the oligarchs,<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106_106">106</a> and had great influence in the
senate, failed on a former occasion when he was a candidate
for the consulship, at the time when Caius brought
forward Fannius and canvassed against Opimius; but
now, being supported by a powerful party, it was expected
that Opimius would be elected consul and would put down
Caius, whose influence was already in some degree on the
wane, and the people also were tired of such measures as
his, for there were many who sought their favour, and
the senate easily gave way.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="d12"></a> On his return from Libya, Caius removed from the
Palatium to the neighbourhood of the Forum, as being a
more popular place of residence, for it happened that most
of the lowest classes of the poor lived there; he next promulgated
the rest of his measures, intending to take the
vote of the people upon them. As crowds were collecting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>from all parts to support Caius, the senate prevailed on
the consul Fannius to drive out of the city all who were
not Romans. Accordingly a strange and unusual proclamation
was made, to the effect that none of the allies or
friends of the Roman state should appear in Rome during
those days; on which Caius published a counter edict, in
which he criminated the consul and promised his support
to the allies if they remained in Rome. But he did not
keep his promise; for though he saw one of them, who
was his own friend and intimate, dragged off by the
officers of Fannius, he passed by without helping him,
whether it was that he feared to put to the test his power
which was now on the decline, or that he did not choose,
as he said, to give his enemies the opportunity which they
were seeking of coming to a collision and a struggle. It
also chanced that he had incurred the ill-will of his fellow-colleagues,
in the following manner:—The people were
going to see an exhibition of gladiators in the Forum, and
most of the magistrates had constructed seats round the
place, with the intention of letting them for hire. But
Caius urged them to remove the seats, that the poor might
be able to see the show without paying. As no one took
any notice of what he said, he waited till the night before
the show, when he went with the workmen whom he had
under him, and removed the seats, and at daybreak he
pointed out to the people that the place was clear; for
which the many considered him a man, but he offended
his colleagues, who viewed him as an audacious and violent
person. Owing to this circumstance, it is supposed, he
lost his third tribunate, though he had most votes, for it
is said that his colleagues acted illegally and fraudulently
in the proclamation and return. This, however, was disputed.
Caius did not bear his failure well: and to his
enemies, who were exulting over him, he is said to have
observed, with more arrogance than was befitting, that
their laugh was a sardonic laugh,<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_107_107">107</a> for they knew not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>what a darkness his political measures had spread all
around them.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="d13"></a> After effecting the election of Opimius to the
consulship, the enemies of Caius began to repeal many
of his laws and to disturb the settlement of Carthage,
for the purpose of irritating Caius, in order that he might
give them some cause of quarrel, and so be got rid of.
He endured this for some time, but his friends, and
especially Fulvius, beginning to urge him on, he again
attempted to combine his partisans against the consul.
On this occasion it is said that his mother also helped him,
by hiring men from remote parts and sending them to
Rome in the disguise of reapers, for it is supposed that
these matters are obscurely alluded to in her letters<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_108_108">108</a>
to her son. Others, on the contrary, say that this was
done quite contrary to the wishes of Cornelia. On the
day on which the party of Opimius intended to repeal
the laws of Caius, the Capitol had been occupied by
the opposite faction early in the morning. The consul
had offered the sacrifices, and one of his officers, named
Quintus Antyllius,<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109_109">109</a> was carrying the viscera to another
part, when he said to the partisans of Fulvius, “Make
way for honest men, you rascals.” Some say that as
he uttered these words he also held out his bare arm
with insulting gestures. However this may be, Antyllius
was killed on the spot, being pierced with large styles<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110_110">110</a>
said to have been made expressly for the purpose. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>people were greatly disturbed at the murder, but it
produced exactly opposite effects on the leaders of the
two parties. Caius was deeply grieved at what had happened,
and abused his party for having given a handle
to their enemies, who had long been looking for it; but
Opimius, as if he had got the opportunity which he
wanted, was highly elated, and urged the people to avenge
the murder.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="d14"></a> A torrent of rain happened to fall just then,
and the meeting was dissolved. Early on the following
day Opimius summoned the senate to transact business.
In the mean time the naked body of Antyllius was placed
on a bier, and, according to arrangement, carried through
the Forum past the senate-house with loud cries and
lamentations. Opimius, though he knew what was going
on, pretended to be surprised at the noise, and the senators
went out to see what was the matter. When the bier had
been set down in the midst of the crowd, the senators
began to express their indignation at so horrible and
monstrous a crime; but this only moved the people to
hate and execrate the oligarchs, who, after murdering
Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol, a tribune, had treated
his body with insult; while Antyllius, a mere servant,
who perhaps had not deserved his fate, yet was mainly
to blame for what happened, was laid out in the Forum,
and surrounded by the Roman senate lamenting and
assisting at the funeral of a hireling; and all this merely
to accomplish the ruin of the only remaining guardian
of the people’s liberties. On returning to the senate-house,
the senators passed a decree<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111_111">111</a> by which the consul
Opimius was directed to save the state in such way as
he could, and to put down the tyrants. Opimius gave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>notice to the senators to arm, and each eques was commanded
to bring in the morning two armed slaves. On
the other side, Fulvius also made preparation and got
together a rabble; but Caius as he left the Forum stood
opposite his father’s statue, and looking at it for some
time without speaking, at last burst into tears, and
fetching a deep sigh, walked away. The sight of this
moved many of the spectators to compassion, and blaming
themselves for deserting the man and betraying him, they
came to the house of Caius and passed the night at his
door; but not in the same manner as those who watched
about the house of Fulvius, for they spent the night in
tumult and shouting, drinking, and bragging what they
would do. Fulvius himself, who was the first to get
drunk, spoke and acted in a way quite unseemly for a
man of his age. The followers of Caius, viewing the
state of affairs as a public calamity, kept quiet, thinking
of the future, and they passed the night watching and
sleeping in turns.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="d15"></a> At daybreak Fulvius was with difficulty roused
from his drunken sleep, and his partisans, arming themselves
with the warlike spoils in his house, which he had
taken in his victory over the Gauls during his consulship,
with loud threats and shouts went to seize the Aventine
Hill.<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112_112">112</a> Caius would not arm, but went out in his toga
just as if he was proceeding to the Forum, with only a
short dagger at his side. As he was going out at the
door, his wife met him, and throwing one arm round him,
while she held in the other their little child, said, “Caius,
not as in time past do I take my leave of you going to the
Rostra as tribune and as legislator, nor yet going to a
glorious war, where, if you died in the service of your
country, you would still leave me an honoured grief; but
you are going to expose yourself to the murderers of Tiberius:
’tis right indeed to go unarmed, and to suffer rather
than do wrong, but you will perish without benefiting the
state. The worst has now prevailed; force and the sword
determine all controversies. If your brother had died at
Numantia, his body would have been restored to us on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>usual terms of war; but now perchance I too shall have to
supplicate some river or the sea to render up to me your
corpse from its keeping. What faith can we put in the
laws or in the deities since the murder of Tiberius?”
While Licinia was thus giving vent to sorrow, Gracchus
gently freed himself from his wife’s embrace, and
went off in silence with his friends. Licinia, as she
attempted to lay hold of his dress, fell down on the floor,
and lay there some time speechless, until her slaves took
her up fainting, and carried her to her brother Crassus.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="d16"></a> When they were all assembled, Fulvius, at the
request of Caius, sent his younger son with a caduceus<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113_113">113</a>
to the Forum. He was a most beautiful youth, and with
great decorum and modesty, and with tears in his eyes he
addressed to the consul and the senate the message of
conciliation. The majority who were present were not
disinclined to come to terms; but Opimius replied, that
Fulvius and Gracchus must not attempt to bring the
senate to an accommodation through the medium of a
messenger; they must consider themselves as citizens who
had to account for their conduct, and come down and
surrender, and then beg for mercy; he further told the
youth that these were the terms on which he must come
a second time, or not at all. Now Caius, it is said,
wished to go and clear himself before the senate, but as no
one else assented, Fulvius again sent his son to address the
senate on their behalf in the same terms as before. But
Opimius, who was eager to come to blows, forthwith ordered
the youth to be seized and put in prison, and advanced
against the party of Fulvius with many legionary soldiers
and Cretan bowmen<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114_114">114</a> who mainly contributed to put them
into confusion by discharging their arrows and wounding
them. The partisans of Fulvius being put to flight, he
made his escape into a bath that was not used where he
was soon discovered and put to death with his elder son.
Caius was not observed to take any part in the contest,
but greatly troubled at what was taking place, he retired
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>to the temple of Diana, and was going to kill himself there,
but was prevented by his faithful friends Pomponius and
Licinius, who took the sword away and induced him to fly.
It is said that he went down on his knees in the temple,
and stretching out his hands to the statue of the goddess,
prayed that the Roman people, for their ingratitude and
treachery to him, might always be slaves; for the greater
part of them had openly gone over to the other side upon
an amnesty<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115_115">115</a> being proclaimed.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="d17"></a> In his flight Caius was followed by his enemies,
who were near overtaking him at the wooden bridge,<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116_116">116</a>
but his two friends, bidding him make his escape, opposed
the pursuers and allowed no man to pass the head of the
bridge till they were killed. Caius was accompanied by a
single slave, named Philocrates,<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_117_117">117</a> and though all the spectators
urged him to fly, just as if they were shouting
at a race, yet no one, though he prayed for it, would come
to his aid or lend him a horse: for the pursuers were close
upon him. He just escaped into a sacred grove of the
Furies,<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_118_118">118</a> and there he fell by the hand of Philocrates, who
killed himself on the body of his master. Some say
both of them were taken alive by their enemies, and that
the slave embraced his master so closely, that Caius could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>not be struck until the slave had been dispatched first, and
with many blows. It is said that a man cut off the head
of Caius and was carrying it away, but it was taken from
him by a friend of Opimius named Septimuleius; for
proclamation had been made at the beginning of the
contest, that those who brought the heads of Caius and
Fulvius should have their weight in gold. The head
of Caius was brought to Opimius by Septimuleius stuck on
a spear, and it weighed seventeen pounds and two-thirds in
the scales. Septimuleius was a scoundrel and a knave<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_119_119">119</a>
here also, for he had taken out the brain and dropped
melted lead in its place. Those who brought the head of
Fulvius got nothing, for they belonged to the lower
class. The bodies of Caius and Fulvius and their partisans
were thrown into the river, the number of dead being
three thousand: their property was sold and the produce
paid into the treasury. They also forbade the women to
lament for their relatives, and Licinia was deprived of her
marriage portion. But their conduct was most cruel to
the younger son of Fulvius, who had neither raised up his
hand against them nor been among the combatants; for
he was seized before the battle, when he came to treat of
terms, and was put to death after the battle. But what
most of all vexed the people was the circumstance of
Opimius erecting a temple to Concord, which was viewed
as an evidence of his insolence and arrogance, and as a
kind of triumph for the slaughter of so many citizens.
Accordingly by night some person wrote under the inscription
on the temple the following line:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The work of Discord<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_120_120">120</a> makes the temple of Concord.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="d18"></a> This Opimius,<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_121_121">121</a> the first man that ever exercised
the dictatorial power in the office of consul, and who
had condemned without trial three thousand citizens, and
among them Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122_122">122</a>—Flaccus,
a consular, who had enjoyed a triumph;
Gracchus, the first man of his age in character and reputation—this
Opimius did not keep himself free from
corruption. Being sent as a commissioner to Jugurtha,
the Numidian, he was bribed by him, and being convicted
of most shameful corruption, he spent the last years of his
life in infamy, hated and insulted by the people, who,
though humbled and depressed for the time, soon showed
how much they desired and regretted the Gracchi. For
they had statues of the two brothers made and set up in
public places, and the spots on which they fell were declared
sacred ground, to which people brought all the first
fruits of the seasons, and many persons daily offered sacrifices
there and worshipped, just as at the temples of the gods.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="d19"></a> Cornelia is said to have borne her misfortunes
with a noble and elevated spirit, and to have said of the
sacred ground on which her sons were murdered, that
they had a tomb worthy of them. She resided in the
neighbourhood of Misenum, without making any change
in her usual mode of life. She had many friends, and
her hospitable table was always crowded with guests;
Greeks and learned men were constantly about her, and
kings sent and received presents from her. To all her
visitors and friends she was a most agreeable companion:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]<br>[Pg 113]<br>[Pg 114]</a></span>she would tell them of the life and habits of her father
Africanus, and, what is most surprising, would speak of
her sons without showing sorrow or shedding a tear,
relating their sufferings and their deeds to her inquiring
friends as if she was speaking of the men of olden time.
This made some think that her understanding had been
impaired by old age or the greatness of her sorrows, and
that she was dull to all sense of her misfortunes, while in
fact such people themselves were too dull to see what a
support it is against grief to have a noble nature, and to
be of honourable lineage and honourably bred; and that
though fortune has often the advantage over virtue
in its attempts to guard against evils, yet she cannot
take away from virtue the power of enduring them with
fortitude.<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123_123">123</a></p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>
<h2>COMPARISON OF TIBERIUS AND CAIUS
GRACCHUS WITH AGIS AND KLEOMENES.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="e1"></a> Now that we have completed the narrative of these
men’s lives, it remains for us to compare them with one
another. As for the Gracchi, not even their bitterest
enemies could deny that they were the most virtuous of
all the Romans, or that they were excellently well
nurtured and educated; while Agis and Kleomenes
appear to have excelled them in strength of mind, because
they both, after having been brought up in the same
fashion by which their elders had been corrupted, became
the restorers of temperance and simplicity of life. Furthermore,
the Gracchi, who lived at a period when Rome was
at the height of its greatness and renown, felt ashamed to
fall short of the glorious achievements of their forefathers;
while the virtuous impulses of the others were not checked
by their fathers having pursued the opposite course of
policy, or by the miserable and distracted condition of
their country. The greatest proof of the unselfishness and
indifference to money of the Gracchi is that they filled
various offices in the state, and yet kept their hands clean
from dishonest gains; while it would be an insult to Agis
to praise him for not having taken other men’s money, as
he gave up to his countrymen his own private property,
which alone was worth six hundred talents. If then he
thought it discreditable for him to be richer than any of
his countrymen, even though his riches were lawfully
acquired, what must have been his abhorrence of those
who obtain money wrongfully.</p>
<p>II.<a id="e2"></a> There was also a great difference in the boldness and
extent of their schemes of reform. The Gracchi were
chiefly engaged in the construction of roads and the founding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of cities, and Tiberius’s most important measure of
reform was the division of the public lands among the
people, while the best act of his brother Caius was the
establishment of a mixed tribunal by adding to the three
hundred Senators three hundred Roman Knights. The
revolution effected by Agis and Kleomenes was of quite a
different kind. They thought, in Plato’s words, that to
proceed by slow degrees was merely cutting off the heads
of the hydra,<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124_124">124</a> and therefore they by one comprehensive
measure swept away all abuses at once: although it would
be nearer the truth to say that they swept all abuses out
of the state by restoring to it its original constitution. It
may also be observed that the reforms of the Gracchi were
opposed by some of the most powerful men in Rome,
whereas the legislation which was begun by Agis, and
completed by Kleomenes, followed a famous and ancient
precedent, the rhetras on sobriety and equality which had
been communicated to their ancestors by Lykurgus with
the sanction of the Pythian Apollo. It is also most
important to notice that the reforms of the Gracchi made
Rome no greater than she was before, while the acts of
Kleomenes enabled him in a short time to make Sparta
mistress of the whole of Peloponnesus, and to engage in a
contest with the most powerful man of his time, with the
object of ridding Greece from Illyrian and Gaulish
mercenary troops, and of renewing its ancient glories
under the rule of the Herakleidæ.</p>
<p>III.<a id="e3"></a> I think too that the deaths of these men show a
certain difference in their courage. The Gracchi fought
with their countrymen, and were slain by them while
flying, while of the other two, Agis may almost be said to
have died voluntarily, because he would not put a citizen
to death, while Kleomenes, when insulted and ill-treated,
fiercely attempted to avenge himself, and as circumstances
prevented his succeeding, bravely killed himself. It may
be said on the other side that Agis never distinguished
himself in the field, and we may set against the many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>brilliant victories of Kleomenes the scaling of the wall of
Carthage by Tiberius Gracchus, no slight achievement,
and the peace which he made with the Numantines, by
which he saved the lives of twenty thousand Roman
soldiers, who could not otherwise have hoped to survive;
while Caius, in several campaigns both in Italy and
Sardinia, showed great military skill; so that they both
might have rivalled the fame of the greatest generals of
Rome, had they not been cut off so soon.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="e4"></a> In political matters Agis appears to have shown
weakness, as he allowed Agesilaus to cheat the citizens out
of their promised redistribution of lands, and in a feeble
and vacillating manner announced his intention and then
abandoned it. The cause of his irresolution was his
extreme youth; while Kleomenes on the other hand
effected his revolution with too great promptitude and
daring, putting the Ephors to death without a trial, when
it would have been easy for him to have won them over to
his side, and banishing many of the citizens. It is not the
part either of a wise physician or of a good politician to
use the knife except in the last extremity, but it shows a
want of skill in both, and in the latter case it is unjust as
well as cruel. Of the Gracchi, neither would begin a civil
war, and Caius is said not even to have defended himself
when struck, but though forward enough in battle he
was loth to fight in a party quarrel; for he appeared in
public unarmed, and retired when fighting began, and
evidently took more pains not to do any harm than not to
suffer any. For this reason we must regard the flight of
both the Gracchi as a proof, not of cowardice, but of
caution; for they must either have retreated when attacked
or have retaliated upon their opponents.</p>
<p>V.<a id="e5"></a> The heaviest charge that can be brought against
Tiberius is that he deposed his colleague from the tribuneship,
and afterwards sought a second tribuneship for
himself. As for the murder of Antyllius, Caius Gracchus
was most falsely and unjustly accused of it, for he did not
wish him to die, and was grieved at his death. Again
Kleomenes, not to speak of his massacre of the Ephors, set
all the slaves at liberty, and practically made himself
despot of the kingdom, although for form’s sake he <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>associated
his brother with him, who was of the same family. And
when Archidamus, who was the next heir to the throne of
the other royal house, was persuaded by him to return
from Messene to Sparta, as Kleomenes did not avenge his
death, he caused men to suspect that he himself had some
share in it. Yet Lykurgus, whom he affected to imitate,
abdicated the throne of his own free will in favour of his
nephew Charilaus, and fearing that if the child died by
any mischance he might be thought guilty of having
caused its death, he travelled abroad for a long time and
did not return until Charilaus had begotten a son to
succeed him. However, no Greek can bear comparison
with Lykurgus; yet we have proved that Kleomenes
effected greater reforms, and showed less respect to the
laws than any of the others. Both the Greeks have been
blamed for having from the very outset aimed at being
nothing more than warlike despots; while the worst
enemies of the Romans only charge them with an
immoderate ambition, and admit that they became so
excited by the contest with their political opponents that
the natural heat of their temper drove them in spite of
themselves like a baleful gust of wind to advocate extreme
measures. What indeed can be more just or honourable
than the objects with which they started; for their troubles
were brought upon them by the opposition which the rich
offered to their laws, so that the one was forced to fight to
save his own life, while the other endeavoured to avenge
his brother, who was slain without law or justice? From
what has been said the reader can himself form an opinion
about their respective merits, but if I must say what I
think of each, I should give the highest place in respect
of virtue to Tiberius Gracchus; I think that the young
Agis committed the fewest crimes; while in daring and
action Caius fell far short of Kleomenes.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF DEMOSTHENES.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="f1"></a> The writer of the Ode to Alkibiades on the occasion of
his winning the chariot-race at Olympia, whether he was
Euripides, as is commonly supposed, or some other poet,
my friend Sossius, tells us that the first thing necessary
for a perfectly happy man is that he should be born a
citizen of some famous city. But for my own part I
believe that for the enjoyment of true happiness, which
depends chiefly upon a man’s character and disposition,
it makes no difference whether he be born in an obscure
state or of an ill-favoured mother, or not. It would
indeed be absurd if one were to suppose that the town
of Iulis, which is only a small part of the little island of
Keos or Ægina, which some Athenian bade his countrymen
clear away because it was an eyesore to Peiræus,
should be able to produce good actors and poets, and yet
be unable to bring forth a just, virtuous, sensible and high-minded
man. We may reasonably expect that those arts
by which men gain glory or profit should be neglected
and fall into decay in small and obscure towns; but
virtue, like a hardy plant, can take root in any country
where it meets with noble natures and industrious disposition.
I myself therefore must lay the blame of my
intellectual and moral shortcomings, not upon the insignificance
of my native city, but upon myself.</p>
<p>II.<a id="f2"></a> However, when a man is engaged in compiling a
history from materials which are not ready to his hand,
but for the most part are to be found scattered through
other foreign towns, it becomes really of the first importance
that he should live in some famous, cultivated, and
populous city, where he can have unlimited access to
books of all kinds, and where he can also personally <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>collect
and inquire into the truth of those stories which, though
not reduced to writing, are all the more likely to be true
because they rest upon universal popular tradition.
The work of a historian who is deprived of these advantages
must necessarily be defective in many essential
particulars. Now I, who belong to a small city, and who
love to live in it lest it should become even smaller, when
I was at Rome, and during my travels in Italy, found my
time so taken up with political business and with the care
of my pupils in philosophy, that I had no leisure to learn
the Roman language, and have only applied myself to
Latin literature at a very advanced period of life. In this
reading of Latin books, singular as it may appear, I did not
find that the words assisted me to discover the meaning,
but rather that my knowledge of the history enabled me
to find out the meaning of the words. I think that to
speak the Latin language with elegance, to understand it
readily, and to use its various idioms and phrases correctly,
is for a literary man both useful and interesting; but the
amount of study and practice which it requires is considerable
and should only be undertaken by those who are
younger than myself, and who have more leisure time to
devote to the acquisition of such accomplishments.</p>
<p>III.<a id="f3"></a> In consequence of these considerations, in this my
fifth book of Parallel Lives, which deals with the lives of
Demosthenes and Cicero, I intend to describe their
several characters, and to compare them with one another
by means of their political acts, but I do not mean to
examine minutely into their respective speeches, or to
decide which of the two was the more pleasing or the
more able orator. Were I to attempt such a task, I
should be forgetting Ion’s proverb about a “fish out of
water,” like the all-accomplished Cæcilius, who has boldly
taken upon himself to write a comparison of Demosthenes
with Cicero. Perhaps, however, we might begin to doubt
the divine origin of the commandment “know thyself,” if
we found men always ready to apply it. Indeed Heaven
appears to have originally intended to form the characters
of Demosthenes and Cicero on the same model, and in some
instances to have implanted in them precisely the same
qualities, such as great personal ambition, love of freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
and want of courage in the wars, yet to have left much to
chance. I think it would be difficult to find an instance
of any two other orators who both rose from a humble
station to great power and influence, who both opposed
absolute monarchs, both lost favourite daughters, were
both exiled and brought back with honour, who both
when flying from their country a second time fell into the
hands of their enemies, and with whose deaths the liberties
of their countrymen were finally extinguished; so that it
is hard to say whether their resemblance is due more to
nature, which originally moulded their characters alike, or
to fortune, which placed then in exactly similar circumstances.
First, then, I will relate the life of the elder of
the two.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="f4"></a> The father of Demosthenes was also named Demosthenes,
and belonged, according to Theopompus, to the
best class of Athenian citizens. He was commonly called
“the sword cutler,” because he possessed a large workshop
and many slaves skilled in cutlery. As for the accusation
which the orator Æschines brings against his mother,
that she was the daughter of one Gylon, who was banished
for treason, by a foreign woman, we cannot tell whether
it is true or only a calumnious imputation. Demosthenes
was left an orphan at the age of seven years, and was the
heir to considerable property, amounting in all to no less
than fifteen talents. He was scandalously ill-used by his
guardians, who appropriated much of his income, and
neglected the rest so much that he was unable to pay his
teachers. He grew up ignorant of much that a boy of
good birth is expected to learn, partly for this reason, and
partly on account of his weak health, which caused his
mother to keep him away from school. He was a sickly
child, and it is said that the opprobrious nickname of
Batalus was bestowed upon him by his school-fellows
because of his bodily weakness. Batalus, according to
some writers, was an effeminate flute-player, whose habits
were satirized in a comic drama written by Antiphanes.
Others assert that Batalus was a poet who wrote in a
drunken licentious style; and there seems also some
foundation for the belief that this word was used for a
certain part of the human body by the Athenians <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>of
that time. The other nickname of Demosthenes, Argas,
either alludes to his savage and harsh temper, for
some poets use the word to mean a snake; or else it refers
to his speeches, as wearying those who heard them;
for Argas was the name of a poet whose verses were bad and
tiresome. And, as Plato says, so much for this.</p>
<p>V.<a id="f5"></a> We are told that he was first led to turn his attention,
to oratory by the following incident. When Kallistratus
was going to make a speech in court about the affair of
Oropus<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125_125">125</a> great interest was taken in the trial because of
the ability of the orator, who at that time was at the height
of his reputation, and also because of the important
character of the law suit. Demosthenes, hearing his
teachers and attendants making arrangement to be present
at the trial, persuaded his own servant by great entreaties
to take him to hear the speeches. The man, who was
intimate with the doorkeepers of the court, managed to
obtain a place for Demosthenes, in which the boy could
sit unseen by the public and hear all that was said. Kallisthenes
spoke very brilliantly and was much admired. He
excited the envy of Demosthenes by the honours which he
received, as he was escorted home by a long train of friends
who congratulated him upon his success; but the boy was
even more impressed by the power of his eloquence, which
enabled him to deal with everything just as he pleased.
In consequence of this Demosthenes neglected all other
branches of learning, neglected all the sports of childhood,
and laboriously practised and exercised himself in the art
of oratory, meaning some day to become an orator himself.
He studied rhetoric under Isaeus, although Isokrates
was giving lessons at the same time, either, according to
some writers, because, being an orphan, he was unable to
raise the sum of ten minæ which Isokrates demanded as a
fee, or because he thought that the vigorous invective of
Isaeus was more what he required to learn. Hermippus
informs us that he read in some anonymous work that
Demosthenes was a scholar of Plato, and learned much of
the art of speaking from him, while he mentions having
heard from Ktesibius that Demosthenes had been lent the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>works of Isokrates and Alkidamas by one Kallias, a Syracusan,
and some others, and that he used to read and
practise himself in them in secret.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="f6"></a>. When he came of age he at once brought a
series of actions against his guardians for malversation
of his property, while they resorted to every species
of legal subtlety and chicanery to avoid making restitution.
By publicly pleading his cause, as Thucydides
says, “he learned his trade by dangers,” and succeeded in
recovering some of his paternal estate, though but a
small part of that to which he was entitled. He gained,
however, confidence and practice as a public speaker, and
the fascinating excitement and sense of power which he
experienced in these contests emboldened him to become
a professional orator and to deal with political matters.
We are told that Laomedon of Orchomenus, by the advice of
his physicians, used to run long distances as a remedy for
a disease of the spleen from which he suffered, until he not
only overcame his disorder, but was able to enter for races
at the games, and became one of the best long-distance
runners of his time. Even so Demosthenes, who was forced
by his private misfortunes to make his first appearance as
a speaker, gained such skill and power by his success
in the law-courts that he soon took the lead among the
speakers in the public assembly. Yet when he first
addressed the people he was violently coughed down, interrupted
and ridiculed, because his speech was found dull
and tiresome, being confused in style and strained and artificial
in argument. It is said that his voice was weak, and
his pronunciation indistinct, and that, as he was frequently
obliged to pause for want of breath, it was difficult
to follow the meaning of his sentences. At last he left
the public assembly and wandered about Peiræus in
despair. Here he was met by an old man named
Eunomus of Thriasia,<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126_126">126</a> who reproved him and told him that
he did himself great wrong, because, having a manner of
speech extremely like that of Perikles, he permitted
himself to be disheartened by failure, and did not face the
clamour of the rabble boldly, and did not train his body to
be strong enough to support the strain of such contests, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>allowed himself to fall into a weakly and effeminate
condition.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="f7"></a> After a second failure, as he was going home
overwhelmed with shame hiding his face in his cloak,
Satyrus the actor is said to have followed him and joined
him. Demosthenes told him with tears in his eyes that
although he had taken more pains than any other speaker,
and had devoted all his energes to the study of eloquence,
yet he could not gain the ear of the people, but that
ignorant drunken sailors were listened to when they
mounted the tribune, while he was treated with scorn.
On hearing this Satyrus answered, “Demosthenes, what
you say is very true, but I will soon apply a remedy, if
you will recite to me one of the long speeches from the
plays of Sophokles or Euripides.” After Demosthenes had
recited a speech, Satyrus recited the same speech in turn,
and so altered it and gave it so much more grace,
by throwing into it the expression which the verses
required, that it appeared to Demosthenes to be quite
different. Having thus learned how much a speech gains
by a really artistic delivery, Demosthenes perceived that it
was of but little use for him to study the matter of a speech,
unless he also paid attention to the form in which it was
to be presented to his audience. He now built for himself
an underground study, which remained entire down to the
present day, where he daily practised himself in gesture
and declamation, and exercised his voice, and where he
sometimes spent two or three months at a time with
half of his head shaved, so that even if he wished he could
not go out of doors.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="f8"></a> He took, however, his themes and subjects for
declamation from the various topics of the day, which he
learned from those who came to visit him. As soon as
they left him he used to return to his study, and repeated
aloud in the form of a speech all the news which he had
heard, and made comments upon it. He also used to
work up any conversations which he heard, into sentences
and periods for his orations, and would alter, correct and
paraphrase both his own remarks and those of his
friends. This gave rise to the opinion that he was not
really a man of ability, but that his power and skill <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>as
an orator was obtained by laborious study. A great proof
of this was thought to be that Demosthenes seldom spoke
on the spur of the moment, but often when he was present
in the assembly and was called upon by the people to
speak, he would remain silent unless he had prepared
and meditated over his speech. Many of the other orators
ridiculed him for this, and Pytheas in derision said that
his arguments smelt of the lamp. To this Demosthenes
made the bitter retort, “My lamp, Pytheas, sees very
different work from yours.” In conversation with others,
however, he did not altogether deny the practice, but
said that although he never spoke without having made
notes, yet that he often spoke without having written
down everything that he was going to say. He used to
say that this careful preparation of his speeches showed
that he was a true lover of the people, and felt a due
reverence for them; while, on the contrary, to speak
without caring how the people take one’s words proves a
man to be of an overbearing oligarchical disposition, who
would use force rather than persuasion. Many writers
allege, as a proof that Demosthenes dared not speak on
the spur of the moment, that when he attacked Demades
he was always immediately answered by him, but that
he never so answered Demades.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="f9"></a> How then, one might ask, was it that Æschines
in his orations speaks of Demosthenes as a man of unbounded
impudence? or how was it that when Python of
Byzantium was pouring forth a flood of invective against
Athens, Demosthenes alone rose and answered him?
Moreover, when Lamachus of Mytilene, who had written
an encomium upon the Kings of Macedon, Philip and
Alexander, which was full of abuse of the Thebans and
Olynthians, read his composition in public at the Olympic
festival, Demosthenes came up to him and in a fine speech
proved from history how great things the Thebans and
inhabitants of Chalkidike had done for Greece, and what
evils had arisen from the baseness of those who flattered
the Macedonians, till the audience were so much wrought
upon by his eloquence that Lamachus was forced to flee
for his life. The answer to this appears to be that
Demosthenes, although he did not copy Perikles in <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>all
respects, imitated his reserve and dignity of manner, and
his reluctance to speak upon every trivial occasion; and
that he was not so much attracted by the credit which he
might gain by engaging in these encounters, as he was
unwilling rashly to place his power and reputation at the
mercy of fortune. Indeed, his spoken orations had more
fire and daring than the written ones, if we may trust
Eratosthenes, Demetrius of Phalerum, and the comic
poets. Eratosthenes tells us that in his speeches he used
to rave like a Bacchanal, while Demetrius says that once,
as if inspired, he recited the metrical oath:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“By earth, by fountains, and by waterfloods.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>One of the comic poets also calls him “the random talker,”
while another mocks at his fondness for antithesis in
the following verses:</p>
<p><small>“<i>1st Citizen.</i> He got it as he got it back.<br>
<i>2nd Citizen.</i> Demosthenes would willingly have spoken words like these.”</small></p>
<p>Unless indeed Antiphanes meant by this to allude to the
oration on Halonesus, in which Demosthenes advised
the Athenians not to take that island, but to take it back
from Philip.</p>
<p>X.<a id="f10"></a> Yet all admitted that Demades, by his own natural
wit, without art, was invincible; and that he often,
speaking on the spur of the moment, would demolish the
carefully studied orations of Demosthenes. Ariston of
Chios has preserved the opinion of Theophrastus about
these two orators. Theophrastus, when asked what kind
of orator he thought Demosthenes to be, replied, “an
orator worthy of Athens.” When again asked his opinion
of Demades, he replied that he thought him “Too great
for Athens.” The same philosopher relates that Polyeuktus
of Sphettus, one of the chief Athenian statesmen
of the time, used to declare that Demosthenes was the
best orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful
speaker, because his speeches contained the greatest
possible amount of meaning in the fewest words. Demosthenes
himself, whenever Phokion rose to answer him,
was wont to whisper to his friends, “Here comes <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>the
cleaver of my harangues.” It is not clear whether by
this Demosthenes alluded to Phokion’s oratorical skill,
or to his blameless life and high reputation, meaning
that the slightest sign given by a man in whom the
people felt such confidence carried more weight than
the longest oration by anyone else.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="f11"></a> Demetrius of Phalerum has recorded the devices
by which Demosthenes overcame his bodily defects, which
he says he heard from Demosthenes’s own lips when he
was an old man. He corrected the indistinctness of his
articulation and his tendency to lisp by declaiming long
speeches with pebbles in his mouth, while he strengthened
his voice by running or walking up hill, talking the
while, and repeating orations or verses. He also had a
large mirror in his house, and used to stand before it and
study oratorical gestures. We are told that once a man
called upon him and asked him to act as his counsel in a
lawsuit against a man by whom he had been beaten.
“But,” said Demosthenes, “you have not suffered any of
this ill-treatment which you complain of.” At this the
man raised his voice and excitedly exclaimed, “Do you
say, Demosthenes, that I have not been ill-treated?”
“Yes,” answered he, “now I hear the voice of one who
has really been ill-used.” So important did he think the
action and the tone of voice of a speaker to be in carrying
conviction to the minds of his hearers. His manner in
speaking marvellously pleased the common people, though
men of taste, such as Demetrius of Phalerum, thought it
vulgar and affected. Hermippus informs us that Aesion,<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127_127">127</a>
when asked to give his opinion about the orators of former
times and those of his own day, said that the ancient
orators used to address the people in a surprisingly
decorous and dignified manner, but that the speeches of
Demosthenes when read aloud, appeared to him to be
much more carefully constructed and more forcible. It
is indeed unnecessary to say that the written speeches
of Demosthenes are bitter and angry compositions; but
in his impromptu repartees, he often was genuinely witty
and pleasant. As for example, when Demades exclaimed,
“Demosthenes teach me! Will a sow teach Athena?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>”</p>
<p>Demosthenes answered, “This Athena was caught in
adultery in Kollytus<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128_128">128</a> the other day.” And when the
thief who was surnamed Chalkus, that is, Brazen-face,
attempted to sneer at him for sitting up late at night
writing, Demosthenes answered, “I know that my habit
of burning a lamp at night must disconcert you. But,
men of Athens, need we wonder at the thefts which take
place, when we see that our thieves are brazen, and our
walls are only made of clay.” However, although I
could relate several more anecdotes of this kind, I must
now stop, as we ought to discover what remains of the
disposition and character of Demosthenes from a survey
of his political acts.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="f12"></a> He first began to take an active part in public
affairs during the Phokian war, as we learn from his own
words, and as we may also gather from his Philippic orations,
some of which were pronounced after that war was
ended, while the earlier ones touch on those matters most
nearly connected with it. It is evident that when he
prepared the oration against Meidias he was thirty-two
years of age, and had not as yet acquired any fame or
reputation. This appears to me to be the chief reason
for his having made up his quarrel with Meidias for a
sum of money, for he was far from being a “mild-mannered”
man, but keen and savage in avenging the injuries
which he received. It must have been because he saw,
that to ruin a man who was so rich, so able a speaker, and
so well-befriended as Meidias, was too difficult a task for
a man of his political power, and so yielded to the entreaties
of those who begged him to let the action drop; for I do
not believe that the bribe of three thousand drachmae
which he received would by itself have caused Demosthenes
to lay aside the rancorous hatred which he bore to
Meidias, if he had entertained any hopes of obtaining a
verdict against him.</p>
<p>In the defence of the liberties of Greece against the
encroachments of Philip, Demosthenes found a noble theme
for political oratory, which he treated in a manner worthy
of the subject, and soon acquired such renown by his able
and fearless speeches, that he was courted by the king of</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>
<p>Persia himself, and was more talked about in the court
of Philip than any of the other statesmen of the time,
while even his bitterest antagonists admitted that they
had to deal with no mean adversary; for both Æschines
and Hypereides own as much in their invectives against
him.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="f13"></a> I cannot, therefore, understand what Theopompus
meant by saying that he was of an inconstant
disposition, and not able to remain long associated with
any party or any line of policy. It appears rather that he
remained throughout the consistent advocate of the same
principles, and a member of the same political party to
which he originally belonged, and that he not only never
changed his politics in his life, but even lost his life
because he would not change them. He was not like
Demades, who to excuse himself for changing sides pleaded
that he had oftentimes gone against his own words, but
never against the interests of the state. Still less can he
be compared with Melanopus, the political opponent of
Kallistratus, who was often bribed by him to allow some
measure to pass, and on these occasions would say to the
people, “The man is my personal enemy, but I postpone
my personal feelings to the good of my country.” Nikodemus
of Messene, who first took up with Kassander, and
afterwards became the advocate of Demetrius, used to
declare that he never was inconsistent, because it was
always best to obey the strongest party. But in the case
of Demosthenes, unlike these men, we can say that he
never deviated either in word or deed from the one direct
line of policy which he unswervingly pursued to the end.
The philosopher Panætius declares that in most of his
orations, as in that about the Crown, that against Aristokrates,
that on behalf of the persons exempted from taxation
(against Leptines), and in the Philippics, we can
trace the principle that honour ought to be pursued for its
own sake; for in all these he urges his countrymen not to
adopt the most pleasant, the most easy, or the most profitable
line of policy, but often thinks that caution and
even safety should be regarded as of less importance than
honourable conduct; so that if to his noble principles and
high-minded eloquence he had joined warlike courage <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>and
clean hands from bribery, he would have been worthy to
rank, not with Mœrokles, Polyeuktus, and Hypereides,
but with Kimon, Thucydides, Perikles, and other great
men of old.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="f14"></a> Indeed, of his contemporaries, Phokion, although
we cannot approve of the strong Macedonian bias of
his policy, was nowise inferior to Ephialtes, Aristeides,
or Kimon, either in courage or in just dealing; while
Demosthenes, who could not be trusted, as we are told
by Demetrius, to stand his ground in battle, and who
was not altogether proof against the seductions of money—for
though he never would receive a bribe from Philip
or from Macedonia, yet he was overwhelmed by the torrent
of gold which poured from Susa and Ekbatana—was better
able than any one else to praise the great deeds of his
ancestors, but was not equally capable of imitating them.
Yet in spite of these shortcomings, his life was more virtuous
than that of any statesman of his time, with the
exception of Phokion. He used plainer language to the
people than any one else, opposed their wishes, and sharply
reproved them for their mistakes, as we learn from his
orations. Theopompus has recorded that once when the
Athenians called upon him to impeach some person, and
became riotous when he refused, he rose and said, “Men
of Athens, I will always give you my advice, whether you
bid me or not; but I will not accuse men falsely because
you bid me.” His mode of dealing with Antiphon also
was by no means like that of a man who courts the favour
of the people, for when the public assembly acquitted
Antiphon, Demosthenes dragged him before the court of
the Areopagus, and in defiance of the expressed opinion
of the people, proved him guilty of having promised Philip
that he would set fire to the dockyard. The wretched
man was condemned by the court and executed. He also
impeached the priestess Theoris for various evil practices,
and especially for teaching slaves to cheat their masters.
He obtained a verdict against her, and caused her also to
be put to death.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="f15"></a> It is stated that the speech by which Apollodorus
obtained sentence against the general Timotheus, and had
him condemned to pay a large fine, was written for <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>him
by Demosthenes: and he also wrote the speeches against
Phormio and Stephanus, which, as may be supposed,
brought great disgrace upon him. For Phormio actually
used a speech written by Demosthenes to combat Apollodorus,
which was just as if out of one armourer’s shop he had
sold them each daggers to kill one another with. Of his
public speeches, those against Androtion, Timokrates and
Aristokrates were written for other persons, as he had not
at the time of their composition began to speak in public,
being only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age.
The oration against Aristogeiton, he himself pronounced,
as he did also that against Leptines, out of regard for
Ktesippus the son of Chabrias, according to his own account
of the matter, though some say that he was paying
his addresses to the young man’s mother at the time. He
did not, however, marry her, but married a Samian
woman, as we learn from the treatise of Demetrius of
Magnesia on Synonyms. It is not clear whether the
oration against Æschines for the dishonest embassage was
ever spoken; although we are told by Idomeneus that
Æschines was only acquitted by thirty votes. This,
however, cannot be true, judging from the speeches of
Demosthenes and Æschines “on the Crown:” for neither of
them distinctly alludes to that affair as having ever come
into court. This point, therefore, I shall leave for others
to determine.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="f16"></a> Before the war broke out no one could doubt
which side Demosthenes would take, as he never allowed
any act of the King of Macedonia to pass unnoticed, but
seized every opportunity of rousing and exciting his
countrymen to oppose him. In consequence of this his
name became well known at the court of Philip, and
when he was sent with nine others to Macedonia on an
embassy, Philip listened to the speeches of them all, but
replied to his speech with the greatest care. He did not,
however, pay so much attention to Demosthenes in the
entertainment which he provided for the ambassadors,
but took especial pains to win the favour of Æschines and
Philokrates. Hence, when these men praised Philip as
being more eloquent, more handsome, and to crown all,
able to drink more than any one else, Demosthenes sneeringly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
replied that the first of these qualities was excellent
in a sophist, the second in a woman, and the third in a
sponge, but that they were none of them such as became
a king.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="f17"></a> When war finally broke out, as Philip was
unable to remain quiet, while the Athenians were urged
on by Demosthenes, his first measure was to prevail upon
the Athenians to recover Eubœa, which had been handed
over to Philip by its local rulers. In pursuance of a
decree which bore the name of Demosthenes, the Athenians
crossed into the island and drove out the Macedonians.
Next, as Philip was besieging Byzantium and
Perinthus, Demosthenes prevailed upon his countrymen
to lay aside their anger and forget the wrongs which they
had received from the people of those cities in the social
war, and to send them a reinforcement by which they
were saved. After this he travelled through Greece,
exciting a spirit of resistance to Philip by his speeches,
until he succeeded in forming nearly all the Greek cities
into a confederacy against Philip, organised an army of
fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry,
besides the local forces of each city, and induced them to
subscribe cheerfully for the maintenance of the mercenaries
and the expenses of the war. At this time, we are
told by Theophrastus that, when the allies demanded that
their contributions should be limited to some fixed sum,
Krobylus the Athenian orator answered that war feeds
not by a fixed allowance.<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129_129">129</a> Greece was now in a flutter
of expectation, and the people of Eubœa, Achaia, Corinth,
Megara, Leukas and Korkyra were all in arms. Yet the
hardest task of all still remained for Demosthenes to accomplish,
namely, to induce the Thebans to join the
alliance, because their territory bordered upon that of
Athens, and their army was very important, for at that
time Thebes was the most warlike state in Greece. It
was no easy matter to win over the Thebans, who had
just received signal assistance from Philip in their war
against the Phokians, and so were inclined to take his side,
besides which, their being such near neighbours to the
Athenians caused perpetual jealousies and quarrels between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>the two countries, which were renewed upon the most
trifling occasions.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="f18"></a> Yet when Philip, excited by his success at
Amphissa, suddenly marched to Elatea and made himself
master of Phokis, when all the Athenians were panic-stricken,
and no one dared to ascend the bema, or knew
what to say, Demosthenes alone came forward and advised
them to stand by the Thebans; and after having, after
his wont, encouraged and comforted the people, he was
sent with some others as ambassador to Thebes. We
learn from the historian Marsyas that Philip, too, sent the
Macedonians Amyntas and Klearchus, the Thessalian
Daochus, and Thrasydaeus to Thebes to argue on his
behalf. The Thebans on this occasion saw clearly enough
on which side their interests lay, for the sufferings they
had just endured in the Phokian war were still fresh in
their memories; but we read in the history of Theopompus
that the eloquence of Demosthenes so roused and inflamed
their courage that all cold-blooded calculation of the
chances, fear of the enemy, and considerations of expediency
were entirely lost sight of in the honourable
enthusiasm created by his speech. So powerful did his
oratory prove, that Philip at once sent an embassy to ask
for terms of peace, while Greece stood erect and watchful.
Not only the Athenian generals, but even the Boeotarchs
took their orders from Demosthenes, and he was as powerful
in the public assembly of the Thebans as in that of
Athens, being beloved by both nations and possessed of a
power which was not beyond his deserts, as Theopompus
says, but which he well deserved.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="f19"></a> But some fatal destiny seemed now to have
brought round the hour for the extinction of the liberties
of Greece, and both counteracted his efforts, and also gave
many ominous indications of what was to come. The
Pythia at Delphi uttered terrible predictions, and an old
oracle of the Sibyls was in every one’s mouth, which ran
as follows:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Far from the battle, on that fatal day</div>
<div class="line">Beside Thermodon may I flee away,</div>
<div class="line">Or view it as an eagle from the sky;</div>
<div class="line">There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>
<p>It is said that the Thermodon is a little rivulet near my
own town of Chæronea which runs into the Kephisus.
We Chæroneans nowadays do not know of any rivulet
which is so called, but we suppose that the stream which
we call Hæmon was at that period called the Thermodon;
for it runs past the temple of Herakles, where the Greek
army encamped: and we imagine that when the battle
took place this stream was filled with blood and corpses,
and became known by its present name. Yet the historian
Douris writes that the Thermodon was not a river at all,
but that some men while digging a trench round their
tent found a small stone image, with an inscription saying
that it represented a man named Thermodon carrying a
wounded Amazon in his arms. Concerning this there was
another oracle current, as follows:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Watch for Thermodon’s field, thou sable crow,</div>
<div class="line">There shalt thou feed on human flesh enow.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XX.<a id="f20"></a> It is hard in these matters to determine the exact
truth: but, be this as it may, Demosthenes was greatly
encouraged to see such a force of armed Greeks at his
disposal, and, elated by their confidence and eagerness for
battle would not allow them to pay any attention to
oracles and predictions, but hinted that the Pythia was in
Philip’s pay, and reminded the Thebans of Epameinondas,
and the Athenians of Perikles, both of whom regarded
such considerations as mere pretexts for cowardice. Up to
this point he behaved as a brave man should; but in
the battle<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_130_130">130</a> itself he performed no honourable exploit
worthy of his speeches, but left his place in the ranks
and ran away in a most shameful manner, throwing away
his arms that he might run faster, and not hesitating to
disgrace the motto of “Good Luck,” which Pytheas
tells us was written in golden letters upon his shield.
Immediately after the victory Philip, in insolent delight
at his success, danced in a drunken revel among the corpses
and sang the opening words of a decree of Demosthenes,
which happened to form an iambic verse, as follows:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Demosthenes Pæanian, son of Demosthenes,” &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>
<p>When, however, he came to himself, and comprehended how
great his danger had been, he trembled at the ability and
power of an orator who had been able to force him in a
few hours of one day to risk both his empire and his life.
The fame of Demosthenes reached even to the King of
Persia, and he sent letters to the Satraps who governed
the provinces near the sea, bidding them offer money to
Demosthenes, and pay him more attention than any other
Greek, because he was able to effect a diversion in favour
of Persia by keeping the King of Macedonia’s hands full.
This was afterwards discovered by Alexander, who found
at Sardis letters from Demosthenes and papers belonging
to the King’s lieutenant, containing an account of the
various sums of money which they had transmitted to him.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="f21"></a> When this great misfortune befell Greece, the
political opponents of Demosthenes at once impeached
him for his conduct; but the people not only acquitted
him of the charges which they brought against him, but
continued to treat him with great honour, and to ask for
his advice. When the remains of those who had fallen at
Chæronea were brought home and buried, they chose him
to make the funeral oration over them, and generally they
bore their misfortunes with a noble spirit, not being
excessively humbled and cast down, as Theopompus relates
in his history, with a view to dramatic effect, but by
showing especial honour and esteem for their principal
adviser they proved that they did not repent of the policy
which they had followed. Demosthenes pronounced the
funeral oration over the fallen, but he never again proposed
a decree in the popular assembly in his own name,
but always in that of some one of his friends, in order to
avoid the evil omen of his own unlucky name, until he
again took courage at the death of Philip, which took
place shortly after his victory at Chæronea. This, it
seems, was the meaning of the last verse of the oracle,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XXII.<a id="f22"></a> Demosthenes had secret intelligence of Philip’s
death, before it was publicly known. In order to inspirit
the Athenians, he went with a cheerful countenance into
the senate, and declared that he had dreamed that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>some
great good fortune was in store for them. Not long afterwards
messengers arrived with the news of Philip’s death.
Upon this the Athenians made sacrifices of thanksgiving
to the gods, and decreed a crown to Pausanias who slew
Philip. Demosthenes also came abroad in a gay dress,
and wearing a garland of flowers on his head, although
his daughter had only been dead seven days. This circumstance
is reported by Æschines, who reviles him for
his conduct, and calls him an unnatural father, though he
only proves the weakness and vulgarity of his own nature
by supposing that noisy demonstrations of grief show tenderness
of heart, and blaming those who bear their sorrows
with dignity and composure. Yet I will not say that the
Athenians did right to wear garlands and make merry at
the death of a king who, after his victory, had dealt so
gently with them when they were at his mercy; for it
deserved the anger of the gods, and was a thoroughly low-minded
act to honour a man while he lived and elect him
a citizen of Athens, and then when he fell by the hand of
a stranger not to be able to contain themselves for joy,
but to dance over his corpse and to sing pæans of victory,
as if they themselves had done some great feat of arms.
On the other hand, I praise Demosthenes for leaving his
own home troubles to be wept for by the women of his
household, and himself coming forward and doing what
he imagined was best for his country. This shows a manly
and patriotic spirit, which ever looks to the good of the
community at large; and I think that in forcing his private
grief to give way to the public joy he acted well,
and even outdid those actors who represent kings and
autocrats on the stage, and who laugh or wail not as their
own feelings bid them, but as the argument of the play
requires. Apart from these considerations, it is our duty
not to forsake a man when he is in sorrow, but to administer
consolation to him and to turn his thoughts to
pleasanter subjects, as physicians bid weak-eyed patients
turn their eyes away from a distressing glare of light and
direct them to green and soothing colours; and what
better means of consolation could one possibly find when
one’s country is fortunate, than to bid one’s friend
merge his private grief in the public joy? I have <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>been
led to make these reflections by observing that this
speech of Æschines has had undue influence with many
persons, because it makes a mistaken appeal to their
tenderer feelings.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="f23"></a> Now Demosthenes a second time began to rouse
the states of Greece and reorganise the confederacy. The
Thebans attacked their Macedonian garrison, and killed
many of them, with arms furnished by Demosthenes, and
the Athenians began to prepare to fight as their allies.
Demosthenes reigned supreme in the popular assembly,
and wrote to the Persian generals in Asia endeavouring to
induce them to attack Alexander, whom he scoffed at as
a child, and nicknamed Margites.<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131_131">131</a> But when Alexander,
after settling the affairs of his kingdom, marched with his
army into Bœotia, the courage of the Athenians deserted
them. Demosthenes himself quailed in terror, and the
Thebans, forsaken by their allies, fought against Alexander
alone, and were utterly ruined. Upon this the
Athenians, in an agony of terror, sent Demosthenes and
several other orators on an embassy to Alexander; but he,
fearing Alexander’s fury, went no further than Mount
Kithæron, and then returned home. Alexander now at
once sent to Athens to demand that ten of her chief orators
should be given up to him, according to the historians
Idomeneus and Douris, though most of the more trustworthy
writers say that he only asked for the eight following:—Demosthenes,
Polyeuktus, Ephialtes, Lykurgus,
Mœrokles, Demon, Kallisthenes and Charidemus. On this
occasion Demosthenes told the people the fable of the sheep
who gave up their watch-dogs to the wolves, explaining
that he and the other orators were the watch-dogs who
guarded the people, and calling Alexander the “great
wolf of Macedon.” “Moreover,” said he, “by delivering
us up you really deliver up yourselves also, just as you see
merchants selling whole cargoes of corn by small samples
of a few grains which they carry about in a cup.” This
we learn from Aristobulus of Kassandrea.<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_132_132">132</a> As the Athenians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
were quite at their wit’s end, and knew not what to
do, Demades at last agreed with the orators whose extradition
was demanded, that in consideration of a sum of
five talents he would himself go to the king of Macedonia
and intercede for them, either because he trusted in the
friendship which existed between him and Alexander, or
because he thought that he should find him like a lion
that has been satiated with slaughter. Demades succeeded
in saving their lives, and arranged terms of peace between
the Athenians and Alexander.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="f24"></a> After Alexander’s departure Demades and his
party were all powerful at Athens, and Demosthenes was
completely humbled. He made an effort to assist the
abortive attempts of Agis<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133_133">133</a> King of Sparta, but as the Athenians
would not take part in the proposed rising, and the
Lacedæmonians were crushed, he again retired into obscurity.
At this time also the action bought by Æschines
against Ktesiphon about the Crown came on for trial.
This action had been formally begun during the archonship
of Chærondas, a short time before the battle of
Chæronea, but it was not decided until ten years later,
in the archonship of Aristophon. This, although a private
action, attracted greater interest than any public one, both
on account of the eloquence of the speakers on both sides
and the spirited behaviour of the judges, who refused to
truckle to the party in power, which had banished
Demosthenes and which was slavishly subservient to
Macedonia, but acquitted Demosthenes by such a splendid
majority that Æschines did not obtain the fifth part of the
votes. He in consequence at once left the city, and
spent the remainder of his life at Rhodes and the other
cities of the Ionian coast as a sophist and teacher of
rhetoric.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="f25"></a> Shortly after this, Harpalus arrived in Athens
from Asia, fleeing from Alexander, whom he feared to
meet, both because he had grossly misconducted himself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>while in command of a province, and because Alexander
had now become a capricious tyrant, terrible even to his
friends. When he sought refuge with the Athenians,
and placed himself, his ships, and his treasure in their
hands, the other orators, casting longing glances at his
wealth, at once pleaded for him, and advised the Athenians
to receive and protect the suppliant. Demosthenes
at first advised them to send Harpalus away, and take care
not to involve the city in war by such unjust and uncalled-for
proceedings: but a few days afterwards when an
inventory was being taken of Harpalus’s property, he,
seeing that Demosthenes was admiring a golden Persian
drinking cup and examining the sculptures with which
it was enriched, bade him take it in his hands and observe
the weight of the gold. Demosthenes was surprised at
the weight, and asked how much it would fetch. Harpalus
answered with a smile, “It will fetch you twenty talents:”
and as soon as it was dark he sent the cup and the twenty
talents to the house of Demosthenes. Harpalus had very
cleverly fathomed the character of Demosthenes by
observing the loving and eager glances with which he
eyed this cup; for he received the bribe and went over to
the side of Harpalus, just as if he were a city which
had received a foreign garrison. Next morning he
carefully bandaged his throat with woollen wrappers, and
proceeded to the assembly, where, when called upon to rise
and speak, he made signs that he had lost his voice. Witty
men said that the orator had not caught a sore throat, but
a silver quinsy during the night. Soon the whole people
learned that he had been bribed, and as they would not
listen to him when he rose to explain his conduct, but
hooted and groaned, some one rose and said, “Men of
Athens, will you not listen to a man who has such a golden
tongue?” The people thereupon sent Harpalus away,
and fearing that inquiry might be made after the treasure
which the orators had received, they instituted a vigorous
search through every man’s house, except that of Kallikles
the son of Arrhenides, which they would not allow to
be searched because his newly-married wife was there.
These particulars we learn from the history of Theopompus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="f26"></a> Demosthenes, wishing to put a good face on the
matter, passed a decree in the assembly, that the senate of
the Areopagus should enquire into the matter, and punish
those who were found guilty. However he was one of the
first whom the senate found guilty: and, although he
came into court and pleaded his cause, he was condemned
to pay a fine of fifty talents, and was imprisoned in
default. Overwhelmed with shame at this disgrace, and
being also in weak health, he could not bear to remain in
prison, and made his escape with the secret assistance of his
keepers. We read that after he had got a short distance
from Athens he saw that he was being pursued by several of
his political opponents, and tried to hide from them. When,
however, they came up to him, addressed him by his name,
and begged him to receive money for his journey from
them, assuring him that they had brought it to give to
him and had pursued him for no other reason, Demosthenes
burst into tears and exclaimed: “I may well be
sorry to leave a home where my very enemies treat me
with more kindness than any friends I am likely to find
abroad will do.” Demosthenes was much depressed by
his banishment, and spent most of his time in Troezene or
Aegina, looking towards Attica with tears in his eyes.
He is said during his exile to have uttered many unmanly
sentiments, very unworthy of his bold speeches when in
power. On leaving the city he stretched out his hands
towards the Acropolis and exclaimed: “Athena, patroness
of Athens, why dost thou delight in those three savage
creatures, the owl, the snake, and the people?” He used
to dissuade the young men whom he met and conversed
with during his travels from taking part in political life,
and would say that such were the miseries, the fears, the
jealousies, backbitings, and ceaseless struggles by which
a public man is beset, that if at the outset of his life he
had known them, and had been offered his choice between
two courses, one leading to the bema and the public
assembly, and the other to utter annihilation, he would
unhesitatingly have chosen the latter.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="f27"></a> While he was in exile Alexander died, and the
Hellenic confederacy was again revived under Leosthenes,
a brave general, who shut up Antipater in Lauria <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>and
besieged him there. Now, Pytheas the orator and Kallimedon,
surnamed the “crab,” who were exiled from
Athens, joined Antipater, and travelled about Greece in
company with his friends and ambassadors, urging the
cities not to join the Athenians and revolt from Macedonia.
Demosthenes, on the other hand, joined the
embassy sent out by Athens and co-operated with them,
striving to induce the Greeks to rise against the Macedonians
and drive them out of Greece. In Arcadia,
Phylarchus tells us that a wordy battle took place
between Pytheas and Demosthenes at a public meeting
in which Pytheas was advocating the cause of Macedonia,
and Demosthenes that of Greece. Pytheas said that we
may always know that there is sickness in a house if we
see asses’ milk carried into it, and that a city must be
in a bad way if it received an embassy from Athens.
To this Demosthenes answered by turning his own illustration
against him, for, he said, asses’ milk is brought
into houses to cure the sick, and Athenians come into
other cities to save them from ruin. The people of Athens
were so delighted with the conduct of Demosthenes in this
matter that they decreed his restoration. The decree
was proposed by Demon, one of the township of Paeania,
and a cousin of Demosthenes; and a trireme was sent
to Aegina to fetch him home. When he landed at Peiræus
he was met by the whole people, and by all the priests
and archons, all of whom greeted him warmly. On this
occasion, Demetrius of Magnesia relates that he raised his
hands to heaven and congratulated himself on having
returned home more gloriously than Alkibiades, because
he had persuaded, not forced, his countrymen to receive
him back. As the fine imposed upon him still remained
in force, for the people could not alter a verdict at their
pleasure, they made use of a legal fiction. It was the
custom at the festival of Zeus the Preserver to pay a sum
of money to those who ornamented the altar for the
sacrifice: they charged Demosthenes with this office, and
ordered him to execute it for the sum of fifty talents,
which was the amount of his fine.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="f28"></a> He did not, however, long enjoy his restoration,
for the Greeks were soon utterly ruined. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>the
month of Metageitnion<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134_134">134</a> the battle of Krannon took place,
in Bœdromion a Macedonian garrison entered Munychia,
and in Pyanepsion Demosthenes was put to death in the
following manner:—As soon as it became known that
Antipater and Kraterus were marching upon Athens,
Demosthenes and his party escaped out of the city, and
the people, at the instance of Demades, condemned them
to death. As they had dispersed to all quarters of Greece,
Antipater sent men in pursuit of them, the chief of whom
was Archias, who was surnamed the Exile-hunter. This
man, who was a citizen of Thurii, is said once to have
been a tragic actor, and to have studied his art under
the celebrated Polus of Ægina. Hermippus reckons Archias
among the pupils of the orator Lakritus, while Demetrius
tells us that he was a student of philosophy of the school
of Anaximenes. This Archias tore away from the shrine
of Æakus at Ægina the orator Hypereides, Aristonikus
of Marathon, and Himeræus, the brother of Demetrius of
Phalerum, who had taken sanctuary there, and sent them
to Antipater at Kleonæ, where they were put to death.
It is even said that Hypereides had his tongue cut out.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="f29"></a> Hearing that Demosthenes was sitting as a
suppliant in the temple of Poseidon at Kalauria,<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135_135">135</a> Archias
crossed over thither in some small boats with a guard of
Thracian mercenaries, and tried to persuade Demosthenes
to leave the temple and accompany him to Antipater,
promising that he should not be ill-treated. Demosthenes
had a strange dream the night before that he was contending
with Archias in acting a play, and that although
he acted well and delighted his audience, yet he was
beaten by Archias, who was better furnished with stage
properties and appliances. Wherefore, when Archias tried
to cajole him, Demosthenes looked him full in the face,
and, without rising, said, “Archias, your acting never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>affected me on the stage, nor will your promises now.”
Upon this Archias became angry, and savagely threatened
him. “Now,” said Demosthenes, “you speak like the
true Macedonian that you are; but just now you were
acting a part. So now wait for a little while until I have
sent a letter home.” Saying this, he retired into the
inner part of the temple, took his tablets as though about
to write, placed his pen in his mouth and bit it, as he
was wont to do when meditating what he should write,
and after remaining so for some time, covered his head
with his robe and leaned it on his arms. The soldiers
standing at the door of the temple jeered at him for a
coward, and Archias walked up to him and bade him rise,
repeating his assurance that he would make Antipater
his friend. Demosthenes, as soon as he perceived that the
poison was beginning to work upon him, uncovered his
head, and, looking steadfastly at Archias, said, “Now, as
soon as you please, you may play the part of Kreon in
the play, and throw my body to the dogs without burial.
But I, good Poseidon, leave thy temple while I am yet
alive, and will not profane the sanctuary by my death
there, though Antipater and his Macedonians have not
feared to pollute it with murder.” Having spoken these
words, he asked them to support him by the arms, as his
strength was fast failing him, and as they were assisting
him to walk past the altar he fell with a groan and died
there.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="f30"></a> As for the poison, Ariston says that it was
contained in his pen,<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136_136">136</a> as has been related. But one
Pappas, from whom Hermippus has borrowed his account
of the scene, says that when Demosthenes fell before the
altar, in his tablets were found written the opening words
of a letter, “Demosthenes to Antipater,” and nothing
more. All were surprised at the suddenness of his death,
but the Thracian mercenaries at the door declared that they
saw him take the poison out of a little cloth and put it
into his mouth. They imagined that what he swallowed
was gold; but a maid-servant that waited on him told
Archias, in answer to his inquiries, that Demosthenes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>had for a long time carried about a packet containing
poison, to be used in case of need. Eratosthenes himself
writes that Demosthenes carried the poison in a hollow
bracelet which he wore on his arm. It would be tedious
to notice all the discrepancies to be found in the numerous
accounts which have been written of the death of
Demosthenes; but I will mention that Demochares, a
relative of Demosthenes, states his belief that he did
not die by poison, but by the provident care of the gods,
who rescued him from the cruelty of the Macedonians by
a swift and painless death. He perished on the sixteenth
day of the month Pyanepsion, which is observed as a day
of the strictest fasting and humiliation by the women
who celebrate the festival of the Thesmophoria.<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137_137">137</a> The
people of Athens soon afterwards bestowed on Demosthenes
the honours which he deserved, by erecting a
brazen statue in memory of him, and decreeing that the
eldest of his family should be maintained in the Prytaneum
for ever. On the base of the statue was inscribed the
celebrated couplet:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Could’st thou have fought as well as thou could’st speak,</div>
<div class="line">The Macedonian ne’er had ruled the Greek.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>It is a complete mistake to suppose, as some writers do,
that Demosthenes himself composed this couplet in
Kalauria just before he took the poison.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="f31"></a> A short time before my own first visit to
Athens, the following incident is said to have taken
place. A soldier, being summoned by his commanding
officer to be tried for some offence, placed all his money
in the hands of the statue of Demosthenes, which are
represented as clasped together. Beside the statue grew
a small plane-tree, and several leaves of this tree, either
blown there by chance, or placed there on purpose by the
soldier, concealed and covered up the money, so that it
remained there a long while. At last the soldier returned
and found it, and as the circumstance became widely
known, many literary men seized the opportunity of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>making epigrams on this striking proof of the incorruptible
honesty of Demosthenes.</p>
<p>Demades did not long enjoy the honour which he had
won, for the gods, in order to avenge Demosthenes, led
him to Macedonia, where he perished miserably by the
hands of those whose favour he had so basely courted.
He had long been disliked by the Macedonian court, and
at last a clear proof of his treasonable practices was
discovered in an intercepted letter of his to Perdikkas,
in which he urged him to seize the throne of Macedonia
and save the Greeks, who were now hanging by an old
and rotten thread (meaning Antipater). On the evidence
of this letter, Deinarchus of Corinth charged him with
treason, and Kassander was so infuriated at his perfidy
that he first stabbed Demades’s own son while in his
father’s arms, and then ordered him to be put to death.
Thus, by inflicting on him the greatest misery which a
man could suffer, he proved to him the truth of that
saying of Demosthenes which he had never before believed,
that traitors first of all betray themselves. You
now, my friend Sossius, know all that I have either read
or heard concerning the life of Demosthenes.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF CICERO.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="g1"></a> They say that Cicero’s mother Helvia<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138_138">138</a> was of good
family and conversation, but as to his father the accounts
are in opposite extremes. For some say that the man
was born and brought up in a fuller’s workshop; but
others carry back his pedigree to Tullus Attius,<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139_139">139</a> who
reigned with distinction among the Volsci and fought
against the Romans with no small vigour. However, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>first of the family who got the cognomen of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_140_140">140</a> must
have been a man of note, and this was the reason why
his descendants did not reject the name, but were well
pleased with it, though it was a matter of jeering to
many: for the Latins call a vetch Cicer, and the first
Cicero had at the end of his nose a cleft or split, slightly
marked as we may suppose, like the cleft in a vetch,
whence he got the cognomen. Indeed Cicero himself,
the subject of this Life, on his friends advising him
when he was first a candidate for office and began to
engage in public life, to get rid of the name and take
another, is reported to have boldly replied that he would
strive to make the name of Cicero more glorious than
that of Scaurus and Catulus. While he was quæstor in
Sicily, and causing a silver offering to the gods to be made,
he had inscribed on it his first two names, Marcus and
Tullius, but in place of the third he jocosely ordered the
artist to cut the figure of a vetch by the side of the
characters. This then is what is recorded about the
name.</p>
<p>II.<a id="g2"></a> They say that Cicero’s mother gave birth<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_141_141">141</a> to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>after a painless and easy labor, on the third day of the
new calends, on which the magistrates now offer up
prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the Emperor. It is
said that a vision appeared to his nurse and foretold her
that she was nurturing a great blessing for all Romans.
Such things as these are generally considered to be mere
dreams and idle talk, but in his case Cicero soon showed
that it was a real prophecy when he was of age to be
taught, for he was conspicuous for his natural talent and
got a name and reputation among the boys, so that their
fathers used to visit the schools out of desire to see
Cicero, and to inquire of his famed quickness and capacity
for learning; but the ill-educated part were angry with
their sons when they saw them giving Cicero a place in
the midst of them in the public roads by way of honour.
Cicero, who had a talent, such as Plato<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_142_142">142</a> requires in a
nature that loves learning and loves wisdom, for embracing
all knowledge and undervaluing no kind of learning
and discipline, happened to show a strong inclination to
poetry: and indeed a small poem of his is still preserved,
which was written when he was a boy: it is entitled
Pontius Glaucus,<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_143_143">143</a> and is in tetrameter verse. In the
course of time he applied himself to the Muse of such
arts with still more versatility, and got the reputation of
being not only the first orator, but also the best poet<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144_144">144</a>
among the Romans. Now his oratorical reputation continues
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
to the present day, though there has been no
small innovation in matters that concern eloquence;
but as to his poetical reputation, owing to many poets
of genius who have come after him, its fate has been
to die away altogether unknown to fame and unhonoured.</p>
<p>III.<a id="g3"></a> After being released from his youthful studies, he
heard Philo<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145_145">145</a> of the Academy, whom of all the scholars of
Kleitomachus, the Romans admired most for his eloquence
and loved most for his manners. At the same time by
his intimacy with the Mucii,<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146_146">146</a> who were statesmen and
leaders in the Senate, he was aided in getting some
knowledge of the law; and for a time, also, he served in
the army under Sulla in the Marsic war.<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147_147">147</a> But seeing
that matters were coming to a civil war, and from a
civil war to a pure monarchy, betaking himself to a life
of quiet and contemplation, he kept company with learned
Greeks and applied himself to the sciences, until Sulla
had got the mastery, and the state seemed to have
received a settlement. During this time Chrysogonus,<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148_148">148</a>
a freedman of Sulla, having laid an information about a
man’s property as being one of those who were put to
death during the proscriptions, bought it for two thousand
drachmæ. Roscius, the son and heir of the dead man,
complained of this, and showed that the property was of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>the value of two hundred and fifty talents, on which Sulla,
being convicted, was angry, and with the assistance of
Chrysogonus instituted a prosecution against Roscius for
parricide. No one gave Roscius help, but all were deterred
through fear of the severity of Sulla, on which the young
man in his desolate condition had recourse to Cicero, who
was also importuned by his friends, who urged that he
would never again have a more splendid opportunity of
gaining a reputation nor a more honourable. Accordingly
Cicero undertook the defence, and gained credit by his
success; but, being afraid of Sulla, he went into Greece,<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149_149">149</a>
giving out that his bodily health required care. And
indeed he was lean and had little flesh, and owing to
weakness of stomach, he took little food, and that
of a light kind late in the day; his voice was full and
good, but hard and unmanageable, and owing to the
vehemence and passion of his language being continually
carried through the higher notes it gave him alarm about
his health.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="g4"></a> On his arrival at Athens<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150_150">150</a> he became a hearer of
Antiochus of Askalon, being pleased with the easy flow
of his speech and his graceful manner, but he did not
like his doctrinal innovations. For Antiochus was now
seceding from what is called the New Academy, and
deserting the sect of Karneades; whether it was that he
was influenced by the evidence and by the senses, or as
some say, through rivalry and differences with the
followers of Kleitomachus and the partisans of Philo, he
was changing to be a cultivator of the Stoic principle in
most things. But Cicero liked the other doctrines better,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>and attached himself to them in preference, intending, if
he should altogether be excluded from public affairs, to
remove himself to Athens from the Forum and public
life and live there in tranquillity with philosophy. But
when news came that Sulla was dead, and his body
being strengthened by discipline was attaining a vigorous
habit, and his voice being now brought under management
had become pleasant to the ear and powerful, and
was suitably adapted to his habit of body, and his
friends from Rome were sending him many letters and
exhortations, and Antiochus strongly urged him to engage
in public affairs, he began anew to fashion his oratorical
power, as if it were an instrument, and to rouse afresh
his political capacity, by exercising himself in the proper
discipline and attending the rhetoricians of repute.
Accordingly he sailed to Asia and Rhodes;<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151_151">151</a> and among
the Asiatic orators he attended the instruction of Xenokles
of Adramyttium, and Dionysius of Magnesia, and Menippus
of Caria; and in Rhodes, the rhetorician Apollonius,
the son of Molo, and the philosopher Poseidonius. It is
said that Apollonius, who did not understand the Latin
language, requested Cicero to perform his exercises
in Greek; and that Cicero readily complied, thinking
that his faults would thus be better corrected. When he
had finished his exercise, all the rest were amazed, and
vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius,
while he was listening to Cicero, showed no approbation,
and when Cicero had finished he sat for a long time
wrapped in thought; and as Cicero showed his dissatisfaction,
he said, “You indeed, Cicero, I commend and
admire, but I pity the fortune of Greece, seeing that
the only excellent things which were left to us have
been transferred to the Romans by you, learning and
eloquence.”</p>
<p>V.<a id="g5"></a> Now Cicero, full of hope in his course to a political
career, had his ardour dulled by an oracular answer. For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>on consulting the god at Delphi<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152_152">152</a> how he might get most
fame, the Pythia bade him make his own nature, and not
the opinion of the many, his guide in life. At first he
lived with reserve at Rome, and was slow in offering
himself for magistracies, and was undervalued, being
called Greek and pedant, names current among and
familiar to the lowest citizens. But as he was naturally
ambitious and was urged on by his father and friends, he
devoted himself to assisting persons in their causes, and
he did not approach the highest distinction by gradual
steps, but at once blazed forth in reputation, and was far
superior to those who exerted themselves in the Forum.
It is said that he was as defective as Demosthenes in
action, and that accordingly he carefully devoted himself
first to Roscius<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153_153">153</a> the comedian, and then to Æsopus the
tragedian. Of this Æsopus it is told, that when he was
representing on the stage Atreus deliberating how he
should revenge himself on Thyestes, and one of the
servants suddenly ran past him, being transported out of
his reason by his feelings he struck the man with his
sceptre and killed him. Cicero derived no small power of
persuasion from his action.<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154_154">154</a> He used scoffingly to say of
the orators who bawled loud,<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_155_155">155</a> that because of their weakness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
they had recourse to shouting, like lame men leaping
on horses. His readiness at sarcasm and other sharp
sayings was considered well adapted to courts of justice
and clever, but by over use of it he gave offence to many
and got the character of an ill-disposed person.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="g6"></a> Being elected quæstor<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_156_156">156</a> at a time of scarcity of corn,
and having got Sicily as his province, he gave offence to
the people at first by compelling them to send corn to
Rome. But afterwards, when they had proof of his care
and justice and mildness, they respected him as they
never had any governor before. And when many young
Romans of good repute and noble birth, who were under a
charge of neglect of discipline and bad behaviour in the
war, were sent up to the prætor of Sicily, Cicero pleaded
for them in a remarkable manner, and gained their
acquittal. Being accordingly greatly elated at all this, on
his journey to Rome, as he tells us, a ludicrous incident
happened to him. In Campania<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_157_157">157</a> falling in with a man of
rank, whom he considered to be a friend of his, he asked
him what the Romans said about his conduct in Sicily,
and what they thought of it, supposing that the city was
full of his name and of his measures, and upon the man
replying, “But where have you been all this time
Cicero?” he was completely dispirited that his fame was
lost in the city as in a boundless sea and had produced no
glorious result to his reputation; but on reflection he
abated much of his ambition, considering that he was
striving for fame as for a thing indefinite and one which
had no attainable limit. However all along there abided
in him an exceeding love of praise and a strong passion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>for fame, which, often disturbed much of his sound
judgment.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="g7"></a> But when he began to engage more actively in
public concerns, he thought it a shame that artisans, who
make use of inanimate instruments and tools, should be
acquainted with the name of each and its place and use,
and that the political man, whose public acts are effected
by the agency of men, should be indolent and indifferent
about the knowledge of his fellow-citizens. Accordingly
he not only accustomed himself to remember persons’
names, but he also knew the place in which every man
of note dwelt, and the spot where he had his property,
and the friends with whom he was familiar and his
neighbours; and whatever road in Italy he was traversing,
Cicero could easily tell and point out the lands and houses
of his friends. As he had only a small property, though
sufficient and adequate to his expenses, he obtained credit
by accepting neither pay nor presents for his services as
an advocate, and most particularly by his undertaking the
prosecution against Verres,<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_158_158">158</a> who had been prætor of
Sicily. Verres, who had been guilty of great malversation,
was prosecuted by the Sicilians, and Cicero caused
his conviction, not by speeches, but in a manner, as one
may say, by not speaking at all. For as the prætors
favoured Verres, and were putting off the trial to the last
day by adjournments and tricks, and it was clear that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>space of one day would not be sufficient for the speeches
and the trial would not be brought to a conclusion, Cicero
got up and said that the case required no speeches, and
bringing forward the witnesses and taking their evidence
he told the judices to give their vote. Yet many lively
sayings of his at that trial are recorded. The Romans
call a castrated hog “verres.” Now when a man of the
class of libertini named Cæcilius, who was under the
imputation of Judaism, wished to put aside the Siceliots
and be the prosecutor of Verres, Cicero said “What has a
Jew to do with a verres?” Verres also had a son grown
up, who was reputed not to have regard to his youthful
beauty as a person of free birth ought to have.
Accordingly when Cicero was reviled for his effeminacy
by Verres, he replied, “A man should find fault with his
sons at home.”<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_159_159">159</a> The orator Hortensius did not venture
directly to defend the cause of Verres, yet he was induced
to give him his assistance when the damages were
assessed, for which he had received an ivory sphinx as his
reward. Upon Cicero saying something to him in an
oblique way, and Hortensius replying that he had no
skill in solving ænigmas, Cicero answered, “And yet you
have the sphinx<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_160_160">160</a> at home.”</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="g8"></a> Verres being convicted, Cicero laid the damages
at seventy-five ten thousands, and yet he fell under
suspicion of having lowered the damages<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_161_161">161</a> for a bribe.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>However the Siceliots were grateful, and during his
ædileship<a id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_162_162">162</a> they came and brought many things from the
island, from none of which did Cicero make any gain, but
he availed himself of the men’s desire to honour him so
far as to cheapen the market. He possessed a fine place
at Arpi,<a id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_163_163">163</a> and he had an estate near Naples, and another
near Pompeii,<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_164_164">164</a> neither of them large: he had also the
marriage portion of his wife Terentia<a id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_165_165">165</a> to the amount of
ten ten thousands, and a bequest which amounted to
nine ten thousands of denarii. With these means he
lived honourably and moderately, enjoying the company
of the Greeks who were familiar with him, and of the
Romans of learning: he rarely, if ever, lay down to table
before sunset, and not so much because of his occupations,
as because of his health, which suffered much from
the stomach. He was also exact and careful in other
matters that concerned the care of his body, and he
employed both friction and walking a fixed number of
times. By thus regulating his habit of body he maintained
it free from disease, and equal to undergo many
and great trials and labours. He gave up his father’s
house to his brother, and he fixed his own residence on
the Palatine, in order that those who paid their respects
to him might not be troubled by coming a great distance;
and people used to come daily to his doors to pay their
respects, no fewer than those who waited on Crassus
because of his wealth, and on Pompeius because of his
influence with the soldiers, which two were at that time
highest in repute and chief of the Romans. Pompeius
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>also courted Cicero, and Cicero’s policy contributed greatly
to the power and credit of Pompeius.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="g9"></a> Though there were many candidates with him
for the prætorship,<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_166_166">166</a> and men of note, he was proclaimed
first of all; and he was considered to have discharged
his judicial functions with integrity and skill. It is said
that Licinius Macer, a man who of himself had great
weight in the city, and who was also supported by
Crassus, being tried before Cicero for peculation, was so
confident in his power and the exertions made on his
behalf, that while the judices were giving their votes he
went home, and after cutting his hair with all speed, and
putting on a clean dress, as if he had been acquitted,
he was about to return to the Forum; but on Crassus
meeting him near the hall door and telling him that
he was condemned by all the votes, he turned back, took
to his bed and died. And the circumstance brought
Cicero credit for his careful administration of justice.
Vatinius<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_167_167">167</a> was a man whose manner was somewhat rough
and contemptuous towards the magistrates when he was
pleading before them, and his neck was full of swellings:
on one occasion when he was before Cicero, he made a
certain demand, and as Cicero did not grant it forthwith,
but deliberated some time, Vatinius said that he should
not hesitate about it if he were prætor, on which Cicero
quickly answered, “But I have not such a neck as you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span></p><p>While Cicero had still two or three days in his office,
some person brought Manilius<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_168_168">168</a> before him on a charge of
peculation; but Manilius had the goodwill of the people
and their zeal in his favour, as it was considered that
he was attacked on account of Pompeius, whose friend he
was. On Manilius asking for time Cicero gave him only
one day, which was the next; and the people were angry,
inasmuch as the prætors were accustomed to allow ten
days at least to those who were accused. The tribunes
also brought Cicero to the Rostra and found fault with
him, but he prayed to be heard, and he said that as he
had always behaved to accused persons with forbearance
and kindness, so far as the laws allowed, he thought it
would be harsh not to do so in the case of Manilius, and
accordingly he had purposely limited him to the only
day which was at his disposal as prætor, for that to
throw the trial into the period of another prætor’s
jurisdiction was not the part of one who was willing
to help another. These words wrought a wonderful
change in the people, and with many expressions of goodwill
they prayed him to undertake the defence of
Manilius. Cicero readily undertook it, and chiefly for
the sake of Pompeius who was absent, and coming before
the people he again harangued them, in bold terms
censuring the oligarchal faction and the enviers of
Pompeius.</p>
<p>X.<a id="g10"></a> Cicero was invited to the consulship<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_169_169">169</a> no less by
the aristocratical party than by the many who for the
interest of the state gave him their aid, and for the
following reason. The changes which Sulla had introduced
into the constitution at first appeared unseasonable,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>but now they seemed to the many by length of time and
usage to have received a kind of settlement, and not a
bad one; but there were those who sought to shake and
change the present condition of affairs for the sake of
their own gain and not for the public good, while Pompeius
was still fighting with the kings in Pontus and
Armenia, and there was no power in Rome able to resist
those who were for change. These men had for their
head a bold man and an ambitious and one of versatile
temper, Lucius Catilina, who in addition to other great
crimes had once laboured under the imputation of unlawful
commerce with his virgin daughter, and of murdering
his own brother,<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_170_170">170</a> and being afraid of being punished for
this he persuaded Sulla to proscribe his brother among
those who were doomed to die, as if he were still alive.
Him the evil-minded took for their leader, and they gave
various pledges to one another, and among these they
sacrificed a man and ate of his flesh.<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_171_171">171</a> Catilina had
corrupted a large part of the youth in the city by
supplying every one of them with pleasure and banquets,
and amours with women, and furnishing unsparingly the
expense for all this. All Etruria was roused to revolt, and
the greater part of Gaul within the Alps: and Rome was
exposed to the greatest hazard of change, on account
of the inequality in properties, for those who had most
reputation and lofty bearing had impoverished themselves
by theatrical expenses and entertainments, and love
of magistracies and building, and the wealth had all come
into the hands of men of mean birth and low persons,
so that things needed only a slight inclination, and it was
in the power of every man who had courage for the thing
to unsettle the state, which of itself was in a diseased
condition.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="g11"></a> However Catilina, wishing to secure a stronghold,
was a candidate for the consulship, and he was high in
hope that he should be the colleague of Caius Antonius,
a man who of himself was not calculated to be a leader
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>either for good or bad, but one who would add force
to another who was a leader. It was from seeing this
that the majority of the honourable and the good encouraged
Cicero to the consulship, and as the people
readily seconded them, Catilina was rejected, and Cicero
and Caius Antonius were elected. And yet Cicero alone
of the candidates was the son of an eques, not of a
senator.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="g12"></a> Now the designs of Catilina still remained unknown
to the many, but great struggles awaited the
consulship of Cicero. For in the first place, those who
by the laws of Sulla were excluded from magistracies,
being neither weak nor few, became candidates and
attempted to gain popular favour, and they made many
charges against the tyranny of Sulla which were indeed
true and just, but yet they were disturbing the state of
affairs at an unfit time and out of season; and in the next
place the tribunes brought forward measures to the same
purpose, in which they proposed an administration composed
of ten men<a id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_172_172">172</a> with full powers, whose instructions
were to have authority to sell the public property in all
Italy and in all Syria, and all that had lately been acquired
by Pompeius, to try whom they pleased, to send
them into exile, to colonise cities, to take money from the
treasury, and to maintain and raise as many soldiers as
they might require. Accordingly others of the nobles
were in favour of the law, and especially Antonius, the
colleague of Cicero, who expected to be one of the ten.
It was supposed also that he was acquainted with the
designs of Catilina, and was not averse to them on account
of the magnitude of his debts, which chiefly gave alarm
to the nobles. And this was the first object that Cicero
directed his attention to, and he caused the province of
Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_173_173">173</a> to be given to Antonius, and Gaul, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>offered to himself, he declined; and by these favours he
gained over Antonius like a hired actor to play a second
part to himself on behalf of his country. Now when
Antonius was gained and had become tractable, Cicero,
being emboldened, opposed himself to those who were for
making change. Accordingly, in the Senate, he made
an attack upon the law, and so alarmed the promoters of
it that they had nothing to say against him. When they
made a second attempt, and being fully prepared invited
the consuls to appear before the people, Cicero, nothing
alarmed, bade the Senate follow him, and coming forward,
he not only caused the rejection of the law, but made the
tribunes give up even the rest of their measures and to
yield to his overpowering eloquence.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="g13"></a> For this man most of all showed the Romans
what a charm eloquence adds to a good thing, and that
justice is invincible if it be rightly expressed in words,
and that it befits him who duly directs political affairs,
always in his acts to choose the good instead of that which
merely pleases, and in his speech to deprive what is
useful of that which gives pain. And a sample of his
persuasive eloquence was what happened in his consulship
with respect to the public exhibitions. In former
times those of the equestrian class were mingled with
the crowd in the theatres and were spectators among
the people, just as chance would have it; but Marcus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Otho<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_174_174">174</a> in his prætorship was the first who, for the sake of distinction,
separated the equites from the rest of the citizens,
and gave them a particular place, which they still retain.
The people took this as a disparagement of themselves,
and when Otho appeared in the theatre, they hissed for
the purpose of insulting him, but the equites received
him with loud applause. Again the people began to hiss
louder, and the equites to make still greater plaudits.
Upon this they fell to abusing one another, and kept the
theatre in confusion. When Cicero heard of this he came,
and summoning the people to the temple of Bellona both
rebuked and admonished them, on which they went back
to the theatre and loudly applauded Otho, and vied with
the equites in doing honour to the man and showing their
respect.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="g14"></a> The conspirators with Catilina<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_175_175">175</a> at first crouched
and were afraid, but they recovered heart, and assembling
together urged one another to take matters in hand with
more courage before Pompeius returned, who was said
to be now coming home with his force. Catilina was
chiefly stirred up by the old soldiers of Sulla, who were
planted all through Italy, but the greatest number and
the most warlike of them were distributed in the Tuscan
cities, and were again forming visions of robbery and
plunder of the wealth that existed. These men, with
Manlius<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_176_176">176</a> for their leader, one of those who had served
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>with, distinction under Sulla, were on the side of Catilina,
and came to Rome to assist at the Comitia; for Catilina
was again a candidate for the consulship, and had resolved
to kill Cicero in the tumult of the elections. The dæmon
also seemed to pre-signify what was going on by earthquakes
and lightnings and sights. The information from
human testimony was indeed clear, but not sufficient for
conviction of a man of reputation and great power, like
Catilina. Wherefore Cicero deferred the day of election,
and summoning Catilina to the Senate questioned him
about what was reported. Catilina, thinking that there
were many in the Senate who were desirous of change,
and at the same time wishing to make a display before
the conspirators, gave Cicero an insane answer: “What
am I doing so strange, if when there are two bodies, one
lean and wasted, but with a head, and the other headless,
but strong and large, I myself furnish it with a head?”<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_177_177">177</a>
This allusion of his was to the Senate and to the people,
which made Cicero more alarmed, and putting on his
armour he was conducted by all the nobles from his house
and by many of the young men to the Campus Martius.
And he purposely let the people have a glimpse of his
armour by loosing his tunic from his shoulders, and he
showed the spectators there was danger. The people
were enraged and rallied round him, and at last by their
votes they again rejected Catilina, and chose Silanus<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_178_178">178</a> and
Murena consuls.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="g15"></a> Not long after the men in Etruria came together
to support Catilina, and were forming themselves into
companies; and the appointed day for executing their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>plan was near, when there came to Cicero’s house about
midnight men who were among the first and most powerful
in Rome, Marcus Crassus, and Marcus Marcellus,<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_179_179">179</a> and
Scipio Metellus; and knocking at the door and calling
the doorkeeper, they bade him rouse Cicero and tell him
that they were there. And the matter was thus: after
Crassus had supped, the doorkeeper gave him letters
brought by some unknown man, which were addressed
to different persons, and one to Crassus himself without
a signature. Crassus, having read this letter only, and
seeing that the letter intimated that there would be great
bloodshed caused by Catilina and that it urged him to
quit the city, did not open the rest, but went forthwith
to Cicero in alarm at the danger, and desiring to acquit
himself somewhat of the blame which he bore on account
of his friendship with Catilina. Accordingly Cicero after
deliberating convened the Senate at daybreak, and taking
the letters gave them to the persons to whom they were
directed, and bade them read the letters aloud: and all
the letters alike gave notice of a conspiracy. When
Quintus Arrius, a man of prætorian rank, reported the
forming of armed companies in Etruria, and news arrived
that Manlius with a large force was hovering about those
cities expecting every moment something new from Rome,
a decree of the Senate was made to put affairs in the hands
of the consuls, and that the consuls on receiving this commission
should administer the state as they best could,
and save it. The Senate is not used to do this frequently,
but only when they apprehend great danger.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="g16"></a> Cicero upon receiving this authority intrusted
affairs out of the city to Quintus Metellus; he undertook
the care of the city himself, and he daily went forth
guarded by so large a body of men, that when he entered
the Forum those who accompanied him occupied a large
part of the ground, whereupon Catilina, no longer enduring
delay, resolved to make his escape to Manlius, and he commissioned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Marcius<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_180_180">180</a> and Cethegus to arm themselves with
swords, and going to Cicero’s door in the morning on
pretence of paying their respects, to fall on him and kill
him. Fulvia,<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_181_181">181</a> a woman of rank, reported this to Cicero
by night, and exhorted him to be on his guard against
Cethegus and his associate. The men came at daybreak,
and as they were not permitted to enter, they fell to railing
and abuse at the doors, which made them still more
suspected. Cicero going out called the Senate to the
temple of Jupiter the Stayer, whom the Romans call
Stator, which is situated at the commencement of the
Sacred Road as you go up to the Palatine. Catilina also
came there with the rest to make his defence, but none of
the senators would sit down with him, and all moved
from the bench. Catilina began to speak, but he was
interrupted by cries, and at last Cicero got up and bade
him leave the city; for he said it was fit that as he was
administering affairs with words and Catilina with arms,
there should be a wall<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_182_182">182</a> between them. Accordingly
Catilina immediately left the city with three hundred
armed men, and surrounding himself with fasces and axes
as if he were a magistrate, and raising standards he
marched to Manlius; and as about twenty thousand men
altogether were collected, he visited the cities and endeavoured
to persuade them to revolt, so that there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
open war, and Antonius was sent to fight with the now
rebels.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="g17"></a> Those who remained in the city of the persons
who had been corrupted by Catilina were assembled and
encouraged by Cornelius Lentulus Sura,<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_183_183">183</a> a man of illustrious
birth, but who had lived a bad life and been already
expelled from the Senate on account of his licentious
habits. He was then prætor for the second time, as is
the custom for those who recover the senatorial dignity.
It is said that he got the name Sura from the following
circumstance. In the times of Sulla he was quæstor, and
lost and wasted much of the public money. Sulla was
angry at this, and called him to account before the Senate;
but Lentulus, coming forward in a very indifferent and
contemptuous way, said that he had no account to give,
but he offered his leg, as boys were wont to do when they
had made a miss in playing at ball. From this he got
the nickname of Sura, for the Romans call the leg ‘sura.’
Again, being brought to trial he bribed some of the
judices, and was acquitted by two votes only, whereon he
said that what he had given to one of the judices was
fairly wasted, for it was enough to be acquitted by a
single vote. Such being the character of the man, and
being stirred up by Catilina, he was further corrupted by
the vain hopes held out by false prophets and jugglers,
who recited forged verses and predictions, alleged to be
from the Sibylline books, which declared that it was the
law of fate that three Cornelii should be monarchs in
Rome, two of whom had fulfilled their destiny, Cinna<a id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_184_184">184</a> and
Sulla, and that the dæmon was come and had brought the
monarchy to him the third of the Cornelii, and he ought
by all means to accept it, and not to spoil the critical
opportunity by delay like Catilina.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="g18"></a> Accordingly Lentulus designed nothing small
or trivial, but he determined to kill all the senators, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
as many of the rest of the citizens as he could, and to burn
the city, and spare nobody except the children of Pompeius,
whom they intended to seize and keep in their
power as securities for coming to terms with Pompeius,
for already there was strong and sure report of his returning
to Rome from his great expedition. A night had been
fixed for the attempt, one of the Saturnalia,<a id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_185_185">185</a> and they took
and hid in the house of Cethegus swords and tow and brimstone.
They also appointed a hundred men, and assigned by
lot as many parts of Rome to each, in order that by means of
many incendiaries the city might be in a blaze in a short
time on all sides.<a id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_186_186">186</a> Others were to stop up the water conduits
and to kill those who attempted to get water.
While this was going on, there happened to be at Rome
two ambassadors of the Allobroges,<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_187_187">187</a> a nation which especially
at that time was in a bad condition and oppressed
by the supremacy of Rome. The partizans of Lentulus,
considering them suitable persons for stiring up Gaul to
revolt, made them privy to the conspiracy. They gave
these men letters to their Senate and letters to Catilina,
promising liberty to the Senate, and urging Catilina to
free the slaves and to march upon Rome. They also sent
with them to Catilina one Titus<a id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_188_188">188</a> of Croton to carry the
letters. But inasmuch as the conspirators were unsteady
men, who for the most part met one another over wine and
in company with women, and Cicero followed up their
designs with labour and sober consideration and unusual
prudence, and had many men out of their body to keep
watch and to help him in tracking out their doings, and
as he had secret conversation with many of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
were considered to be in the conspiracy and whom he
trusted, he became acquainted with their communication
with the strangers, and laying an ambuscade by night he
seized the man of Croton and the letters, with the secret
assistance of the Allobroges.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="g19"></a> At daybreak<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_189_189">189</a> Cicero, assembling the Senate at the
temple of Concord, read the letters and examined the
informers. Silanus Junius also said that some persons
had heard Cethegus say, that three consuls and four
prætors were going to be killed. Piso, a man of consular
rank, gave evidence to the same effect. Caius Sulpicius,
one of the prætors, being sent to the house of Cethegus,
found there many missiles and arms, and a great quantity
of swords and knives newly sharpened. At length the
Senate having by a vote promised a pardon to the man of
Croton on condition of his giving information, Lentulus
being convicted abdicated his office, for he happened to be
prætor, and laying down his robe with the purple hem
before the Senate assumed a dress suitable to the occasion.
Lentulus and his associates were delivered up to the
prætors to be kept in custody, but without chains. It
was now evening, and the people in crowds were waiting
about the temple, when Cicero came forth and told the
circumstance to the citizens, by whom he was conducted
to the house of a neighbouring friend, for his own house
was occupied by the women who were celebrating the
mysterious rites to a goddess whom the Romans called
Bona,<a id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_190_190">190</a> and the Greeks call Gynæceia. A sacrifice is made
to the goddess annually in the house of the consul by his
wife or his mother in the presence of the Vestal Virgins.
Cicero, going into the house, deliberated with a very few
persons what he should do with the men: for he had some
scruples about inflicting the extreme punishment and that
which was due to such great crimes; and he hesitated
about it both from the humanity of his disposition, and
because he feared that he might seem to be too much
elated with his power and to be handling severely men
who were of the highest rank and had powerful friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
in the State; and if he treated them leniently, he dreaded
danger from them. For he considered that they would
not be well content if they were punished short of death,
but would break forth in all extravagance of audacity and
add fresh indignation to their old villainy; and that he
should be judged a coward and a weak man, especially as
the many had by no means a good opinion of his courage.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="g20"></a> While Cicero was thus doubting, there was a sign
to the women who were sacrificing: for though the fire
seemed to have gone out, the altar sent forth from the
ashes and burnt bark a large and brilliant blaze.<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_191_191">191</a> This
alarmed the women, except the sacred virgins, who urged
Terentia, the wife of Cicero, to go with all speed to her
husband and tell him to take in hand what he had
resolved on behalf of his country, for the goddess was
displaying a great light to lead him to safety and honour.
Terentia, who generally was not a woman of a mild
temper nor naturally without courage, but an ambitious
woman, and as Cicero himself says,<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_192_192">192</a> more ready to share
in his political perplexities than to communicate to him
her domestic matters, reported this to her husband and
stimulated him against the conspirators: in like manner
too his brother Quintus and Publius Nigidius, one of his
philosophical companions, whose advice he used in the
most and chiefest of his political measures. On the
following day<a id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_193_193">193</a> there was a discussion in the Senate about
the punishment of the conspirators, when Silanus, who
was first asked his opinion, said that they ought to be
taken to prison and suffer the extreme punishment: and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
all who spoke in succession acceded to this opinion, till it
came to the turn of Caius Cæsar, who was afterwards
Dictator. Cæsar, who was then a young man and in the
very beginning of his rise to power, and already in his
policy and his hopes had entered on that road by which
he changed the state of Rome into a monarchy, though he
eluded the penetration of the rest, caused great suspicion
to Cicero, without however giving him any hold for
complete proof; but there were some heard to say that
he came near being caught and yet had escaped from
Cicero. However, some say that Cicero purposely overlooked
and neglected the information against Cæsar
through fear of his friends and his power, for it was plain
to every man, that the conspirators would rather become
an appendage<a id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_194_194">194</a> to Cæsar’s acquittal, than Cæsar would
become an appendage to their punishment.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="g21"></a> When, then, it came to Cæsar’s<a id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_195_195">195</a> turn to deliver his
opinion, he rose and expressed it against putting the men
to death, but he proposed to confiscate their property and
remove them to the cities of Italy of which Cicero might
approve, and there keep them confined till Catilina was
defeated. The proposal was merciful and the speaker
most eloquent, and Cicero added to it no small weight, for
when Cicero rose<a id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_196_196">196</a> he handled the matter both ways, partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
arguing in favour of the first opinion and partly in favour
of Cæsar’s; and all his friends thinking that Cæsar’s
opinion was for the advantage of Cicero, for he would be
subject to less blame if he did not condemn the men to
death, chose the second opinion rather, so that even
Silanus himself changed and made his explanation, saying
that neither had he delivered his opinion for death, for
that the extreme punishment to a Roman senator was the
prison. After the opinion was given, Catulus Lutatius
was the first to oppose it; and he was followed by Cato,
who in his speech vehemently urged suspicion against
Cæsar, and so filled the Senate with passion and resolution
that they passed a vote of death against the men. With
respect to the confiscation of their property Cæsar made
opposition, for he did not think it fair that they should
reject the merciful part of his proposition and adopt the
most severe part. As many of them made violent resistance,
he invoked the tribunes, who however paid no
attention to the call, but Cicero himself gave way and
remitted that part of the vote which was for confiscation.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="g22"></a> Cicero went with the Senate to the conspirators,
who were not all in the same place, but kept by the
different prætors. He first took Lentulus<a id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_197_197">197</a> from the
Palatine and led him through the Sacred Road and the
middle of the Forum, with the men of highest rank in a
body around him as his guards, the people the while
shuddering at what was doing and passing by in silence,
and chiefly the youth, who felt as if they were being
initiated with fear and trembling in certain national rites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
of a certain aristocratical power. When Cicero had passed
through the Forum and come to the prison, he delivered
Lentulus to the executioner and told him to put him to
death; he then took down Cethegus and every one of the
rest in order and had them put to death. Seeing that
there were still many members of the conspiracy standing
together in the Forum, who did not know what had been
done and were waiting for the night, supposing that the
men were still alive and might be rescued, Cicero said to
them in a loud voice, “They have lived.” In these terms
the Romans are used to speak of death when they do not
choose to use words of bad omen. It was now evening,
and Cicero went up from the Forum to his house, the
citizens no longer accompanying him in silence or in order,
but receiving him with shouts and clapping as he passed
along and calling him the saviour and founder of his
country. And numerous lights illuminated the streets,
for people placed lamps and torches at their doors. The
women too showed lights from the roofs to honour the
man and in order to see him going home, honourably
attended by the nobles; most of whom, having brought to
an end great wars and entered the city in triumph, and
added to the Roman possessions no small extent of land
and sea, walked along confessing to one another that the
Roman people were indebted for wealth and spoils and
power to many living commanders and generals, but for
their security and safety to Cicero alone, who had removed
from them so great a danger. For it was not the preventing
of what was in preparation and the punishing of the
doers which appeared worthy of admiration, but that he
had quenched the greatest of dangers that ever threatened
the State with the least evils, and without disturbance
and tumult. For most of those who had flocked to
Catilina<a id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_198_198">198</a> as soon as they heard of the fate of Lentulus and
Cethegus left him and went away: and Catilina, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
fighting a battle with those who remained with him
against Antonius, perished and his army with him.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="g23"></a> However there were some who were ready to
abuse Cicero for this and to do him harm, and they had for
their leader among those who were going to hold magistracies,
Cæsar as prætor, and Metellus<a id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_199_199">199</a> and Bestia as
tribunes. Upon entering on office, while Cicero had still
a few days in authority, they would not let him address
the people, and placing their seats above the Rostra they
would not permit him to come forward to speak; they told
him that he might, if he chose, take the oath usual on
giving up office and then go down. Upon this Cicero
came forward as if he were going to take the oath, and when
he had procured silence, he swore not the usual oath, but
one of his own and a new oath, to the effect that he had
saved his country and preserved the supremacy of Rome:
and the whole people confirmed the truth of his oath. At
this Cæsar and the tribunes, being still more vexed, contrived
other cavils against Cicero, and a law was brought
forward by them that Pompeius and his army should be
recalled on the pretext of putting down the power of
Cicero. But Cato, who was then tribune, was a great help
to Cicero and to the whole State, and he opposed himself to
Cæsar’s measures with equal authority and greater good
opinion. For he easily stopped other measures, and he so
extolled the consulship of Cicero in a speech to the people,
that they voted to him the greatest honours that had ever
been conferred and called him the father of his country;
for it seems that Cicero was the first on whom this title
was conferred, upon Cato having so entitled him before the
people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="g24"></a> Cicero, who had at that time the chief power in
the State, made himself generally odious, not by any ill
acts, but by always praising and glorifying himself to the
great annoyance of many people. For there was neither
assembly of Senate nor people nor court of justice in which
a man had not to hear Catilina talked of and Lentulus.
Finally, he filled his books and writings with his own
praises, and though his oratory was most agreeable and
had the greatest charm, he made it wearisome and odious
to the hearers by his unseemly habit, which stuck to him
like a fatality. However, though he had such unmingled
ambition, he was far removed from envying others, for he
was most bountiful in his praises of those before him and
those of his own time, as we may see from his writings.
There are also many sayings of his recorded; for instance,
he said of Aristotle, that he was a river of flowing gold,
and of the dialogues of Plato, that Jupiter, if it were his
nature to use language, would speak like him. Theophrastus
he was used to call his own special luxury.
Being asked about the speeches of Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_200_200">200</a> which he
thought the best, he answered, the longest. Yet some of
those who pretend to be imitators of Demosthenes, dwell
on an expression of Cicero, which is used in a letter to one
of his friends, that Demosthenes sometimes nodded in his
speeches; but the great and admirable praise which he
often bestows on the man, and that he entitled his own
orations on which he bestowed most labour, those against
Antonius, Philippics, they say nothing about. Of the men
of his own time who gained a reputation for eloquence and
learning, there is not one whose reputation he did not
increase either by speaking or writing in favourable terms
of him. When Cæsar was in power he obtained from him
the Roman citizenship for Kratippus<a id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_201_201">201</a> the Peripatetic, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
he prevailed on the Areopagus to pass a vote and to
request him to stay in Athens and instruct the young, as
being an ornament to the city. There are letters from
Cicero to Herodes,<a id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_202_202">202</a> and others to his son, in which he
exhorts to the study of philosophy under Kratippus. He
charged Gorgias<a id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_203_203">203</a> the rhetorician with leading the young
man to pleasure and drinking, and banished him from his
society. This and a letter to Pelops of Byzantium are
almost the only Greek letters of his which are written
with any passion, in which he properly rebukes Gorgias,
if he was worthless and intemperate, as he was considered
to be; but his letter to Pelops is in a mean and complaining
tone, and charges Pelops with having neglected to
procure for him certain honours and public testimonials
from the Byzantines.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="g25"></a> All this proceeded from his ambition, and also
the circumstance that he was often carried away by the
impetuosity of his oratory to disregard propriety. He once
spoke in favour of Munatius,<a id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_204_204">204</a> who after being acquitted
prosecuted Sabinus, a friend of Cicero, who is said to have
been so transported with passion as to say, “Do you
suppose, Munatius, that you were acquitted on your trial
for your own merits, and not because I spread much darkness
over the court when there was light?” He gained
applause by a panegyric on Marcus Crassus from the
Rostra, and a few days after he abused him, on which
Crassus observed, “Did you not lately praise me in the
same place?” to which Cicero replied, “Yes, for practice
sake, exercising my eloquence on a mean subject.” Crassus
having remarked on one occasion that none of the Crassi
had lived in Rome to be more than sixty years of age, and
afterwards denying that he had said so, and observing,
What could have led him to say this? Cicero replied,
“You know that the Romans would be glad to hear it and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
so you wished to get their favour.” When Crassus observed
that he liked the Stoics, because they proved that
the good man was rich,<a id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_205_205">205</a> “Consider,” said Cicero, “if they
do not rather prove that the wise man possesses everything.”
Now Crassus was charged with being fond of
money. One of the sons of Crassus who was considered to
resemble a certain Axius, and so to attach ill fame to his
mother in respect to Axius, had made a speech in the
Senate with applause, and Cicero being asked what he
thought of him said, He is Axius Crassus.<a id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_206_206">206</a></p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="g26"></a> When Crassus<a id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_207_207">207</a> was about to set out for Syria, he
wished Cicero to be his friend rather than his enemy, and
he said in a friendly manner that he wished to sup with
him, and Cicero received him readily. A few days after
when some of his friends spoke with him about Vatinius,
and said that Vatinius sought a recollection and to be on
good terms with him, for he was then at enmity with
Cicero. “Surely,” said Cicero, “Vatinius too does not
want to sup with me.” Such was his behaviour to
Crassus. As to Vatinius, who had tumours in his neck,
and was on one occasion pleading a cause, Cicero called
him a tumid orator. Hearing that Vatinius was dead,
and being shortly after certainly informed that he was
still living, “Ill betide the man,” said he, “who lied so
ill.” Many of the senators were dissatisfied with Cæsar’s
carrying a measure for the distribution of the land in
Campania among the soldiers, and Lucius Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_208_208">208</a> who
was also one of the oldest of them, said, that it should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
never take place while he lived. “Let us wait,” said
Cicero, “for Gellius asks for no long delay.” There
was a certain Octavius<a id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_209_209">209</a> who had the ill-repute of being a
native of Libya, and on the occasion of a certain trial he
said that he could not hear Cicero. “And yet,” said Cicero,
“your ear is not without a hole in it.” Metellus Nepos
observing that Cicero by giving testimony against persons
had caused more to be condemned than he had caused
to be acquitted by undertaking their cause, “Well,” said
he, “I admit that I have more credit than eloquence.” A
certain youth who was charged with giving poison to his
father in a cake, spoke with great confidence, and said
that he would abuse Cicero; “I would rather have this
from you,” said Cicero, “than a cake.” Publius Sextius<a id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_210_210">210</a>
had Cicero with others as his advocate in a cause, but he
chose to say everything himself and would let nobody
else speak, and when it was plain that he would be
acquitted and the judices were giving their votes, Cicero
said, “Make the most of your opportunity to-day, for
to-morrow you will be a mere nobody.” One Publius
Consta,<a id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_211_211">211</a> who set up for a lawyer, but was an ignorant
and stupid fellow, was called as a witness by Cicero
on a trial. On Consta saying that he knew nothing,
“Perhaps,” said Cicero, “you suppose that you are asked
about legal matters.” Metellus Nepos during a dispute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
with Cicero often repeated, “Who is your father?” on
which Cicero said, “As for yourself, your mother has
made this answer rather difficult for you.” Now the
mother of Nepos was considered to be an unchaste
woman, and himself a fickle kind of man. On one
occasion he suddenly deserted his office of tribune and
sailed off to join Pompeius<a id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_212_212">212</a> in Syria, whence he returned
with just as little reason. Nepos had buried his teacher
Philagrus with more than usual respect, and set upon
his tomb a raven of stone: “In this,” said Cicero, “you
have acted wiser than your wont, for he taught you to
fly rather than to speak.” Marcus Appius in a certain
trial prefaced his speech with saying that his friend had
prayed him to exhibit vigilance and judgment and
fidelity: “Are you then,” said Cicero, “so iron-hearted
as to exhibit not one of such great qualities as your friend
prayed you to do?”</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="g27"></a> Now the use of bitterish taunts against enemies
or opposing advocates may be considered as belonging to
the orator’s business; but the attacking of any persons
whom he fell in with, for the purpose of making them
ridiculous, brought great odium upon him. I will record
a few instances of this also. He called Marcus Aquinius,<a id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_213_213">213</a>
Adrastus,<a id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_214_214">214</a> because he had two sons-in-law who were in
exile. Lucius Cotta,<a id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_215_215">215</a> who held the office of censor, was
very fond of wine, and it happened that Cicero during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
his canvass for the consulship was athirst, and as his
friends stood around him while he was drinking, “You
have good reason to be afraid,” said he, “lest the censor
should deal harshly with me for drinking water.” Meeting
Voconius,<a id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_216_216">216</a> who was conducting three very ugly
daughters, he said aloud:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“‘Gainst Phœbus’ will his children he begat.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Marcus Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_217_217">217</a> who was supposed not to be the son of
free parents, was once reading some letters to the Senate
with a clear and loud voice, when Cicero said, “Don’t be
surprised; he too is one of those who have practised their
voices.” When Faustus,<a id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_218_218">218</a> the son of Sulla who had been
dictator in Rome and proscribed many to the death,
having got into debt and squandered most of his substance,
advertised his household stuff for sale, Cicero said that he
liked this proscription better than his father’s.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="g28"></a><a id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_219_219">219</a> He thus became odious to many, and the partizans
of Clodius combined against him on the following
occasion. Clodius was a man of noble birth, young in
years, but bold and impudent in his designs. Being in love
with Pompeia, Cæsar’s wife, he got into his house secretly
by assuming the dress and the guise of a lute-player; for
the women were celebrating in Cæsar’s house those
mysterious rites which the men were not allowed to see;
and as there was no man there, Clodius being still a youth
and not yet bearded hoped to slip through to Pompeia
with the women. But as it was night when he got into
a large house, he was perplexed by the passages; and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
he was rambling about a female slave of Aurelia, Cæsar’s
mother, saw him and asked him his name. Being
compelled to speak, he said that he was looking for a
servant of Pompeia, named Abra, but the woman perceiving
that it was not a female voice cried out and called
the women together. They shut the doors and searching
every place found Clodius, who had hid himself in the
chamber of the girl with whom he came into the house.
The affair being noised abroad Cæsar put away Pompeia,
and a prosecution<a id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_220_220">220</a> for an offence against religion was
instituted against Clodius.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="g29"></a> Now Cicero was a friend of Clodius, and in the
affair of Catilina found him a most zealous assistant and
guardian of his person; but as Clodius in answer to the
charge relied on not having been in Rome at the time,
and maintained that he was staying in places at a very
great distance, Cicero bore testimony that Clodius had
come to his house<a id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_221_221">221</a> and spoken with him on certain
matters; which was true. However people did not
suppose that Cicero gave his testimony from regard to
truth, but by way of justifying himself to his wife
Terentia.<a id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_222_222">222</a> For Terentia had a grudge against Clodius on
account of his sister Clodia, who was supposed to wish to
marry Cicero, and to be contriving this by the aid of one
Tullus, who was one of the nearest companions and
intimates of Cicero, and as Tullus was going to Clodia,
who lived near, and paying attention to her, he excited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
suspicion in Terentia. Now as Terentia was of a sour
temper and governed Cicero, she urged him to join in
the attack on Clodius and to give testimony against him.
Many men also of the highest character charged Clodius
by their testimony with perjury, disorderly conduct,
bribing of the masses, and debauching of women. Lucullus
also produced female slaves to testify that Clodius
had sexual commerce with his youngest sister when she
was the wife of Lucullus. There was also a general
opinion that Clodius debauched his other two sisters, of
whom Marcius Rex had Terentia and Metellus Celer
had Clodia to wife, who was called Quadrantaria, because
one of her lovers put copper coins for her in a purse pretending
they were silver and sent them to her; now the
smallest copper coin the Romans called Quadrans. It
was with regard to this sister that Clodius was most
suspected. However as the people on that occasion set
themselves against those who bore testimony and combined
against Clodius, the judices being afraid procured
a guard for their protection, and most of them gave in
their tablets with the writing on them confused.<a id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_223_223">223</a> It
turned out that those who were for acquitting him were
the majority, and some bribery was also said to have been
used. This led Catulus to say when he met the judices,
“Indeed you did ask for a guard to protect you, for you
were afraid that some one should take your money from
you.” Upon Clodius saying to Cicero that his evidence
had no credit with the judices, Cicero replied, “However,
five-and-twenty<a id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_224_224">224</a> of the judices gave me credit, for so
many of them voted against you; but thirty of them
gave you no credit, for they did not vote for your acquittal
till they had received their money.” Cæsar, however,
when called, gave no evidence against Clodius, and he
denied that he had convicted his wife of adultery, but
that he had put her away, because Cæsar’s wife ought
not only to be free from a shameful act, but even the
report of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>
<p>XXX.<a id="g30"></a> Clodius,<a id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_225_225">225</a> having escaped the danger, as soon as
he was elected tribune commenced his attack on Cicero,
drawing together and agitating against him every thing
and all persons. For he gained the favour of the people
by popular laws, and caused great provinces to be assigned
to each of the consuls, Macedonia to Piso and Syria to
Gabinius, and he contrived to associate many of the poor
citizens in his designs and kept armed slaves about him.
Of the three men who then had the chief power,
Crassus was openly at enmity with Cicero, and Pompeius
was playing an affected part towards both; and as Cæsar
was about to march into Gaul<a id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_226_226">226</a> with his army, Cicero paying
court to him, though he was not his friend, but an
object of suspicion owing to the affair of Catilina, asked to
accompany him as a legatus. Cæsar accepted the proposal,
but Clodius, seeing that Cicero was escaping from his
tribunitian power, pretended to be disposed to come to
terms with him, and by laying most blame on Terentia,
and always speaking of Cicero in moderate terms and
using words which imported a favourable disposition, as a
man who had no hatred or ill feeling towards him, but
had certain reasonable grounds of complaint to be urged
in a friendly way, he completely stopped Cicero’s fears, so
that he declined a legation under Cæsar and again applied
himself to public affairs. At which Cæsar, being irritated,
encouraged Clodius against Cicero, and completely
alienated Pompeius from him, and he himself declared
before the people that he did not consider it right or lawful
for men to be put to death without trial, like Lentulus
and Cethegus. For this was the charge, and to this
Cicero was called to answer. Being therefore in danger
and under prosecution he changed his dress and with his
hair unshorn went about supplicating the people. But
Clodius met him everywhere in the streets with violent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and audacious men about him, who, with many insolent
jeers at Cicero’s reverse and attire, and after pelting
him with mud and stones, hindered his suppliant
applications.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="g31"></a> However at first nearly all the body of equites
changed their dress when Cicero did, and not less than
twenty thousand young men accompanied him with their
hair uncut and joined in his suppliant entreaties. When
the Senate had met in order to pass a vote that the people
should change their dress as a public calamity,<a id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_227_227">227</a> and the
consuls opposed it, and Clodius was in arms about the
Senate-house, no small number of the senators ran out
tearing their clothes and calling aloud. But as this sight
neither procured respect nor pity, and Cicero must either
go into exile or try force and the sword against Clodius,
he entreated Pompeius to aid him, who had purposely gone
out of the way and was staying on his estate at the Alban
hills. And first he sent his son-in-law Piso<a id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_228_228">228</a> to entreat for
him, and then he went himself. Pompeius hearing of his
coming did not wait to see him, for he had a strong feeling
of shame towards a man who had made great efforts on
his behalf, and had carried many public measures to please
him, but as he was Cæsar’s son-in-law, he gave up old
obligations at his request, and slipping out by a different
door evaded meeting with Cicero. Cicero being thus
betrayed by him and left deserted, fled for refuge to the
consuls. Gabinius still maintained his hostility, but
Piso spoke<a id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_229_229">229</a> more kindly, and advised him to go out of the
way and to yield to the impetuosity of Clodius and to
submit to the change in circumstances, and again to be
the saviour of his country, which was involved in civil
commotion and misfortune through Clodius. Having got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
this answer Cicero consulted with his friends, of whom
Lucullus advised him to stay and said that he would gain
the superiority; but others advised him to fly, inasmuch
as the people would soon long for him when they were
satiated with the madness and desperation of Clodius.
This was Cicero’s own judgment; and he carried to the
Capitol the statue of Athene,<a id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_230_230">230</a> which for a long time had
stood in his house, and to which he paid especial honour,
and dedicated it with the inscription, “To Athene the
guardian of Rome;” and receiving from his friends persons
to conduct him safely, he left the city about midnight
and went by land through Lucania, designing to stay in
Sicily.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="g32"></a> When it was known that he had fled, Clodius
put to the vote the question of his banishment, and issued
an edict to exclude him from fire and water, and that no
one should furnish him with a shelter within five hundred
miles<a id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_231_231">231</a> of Italy. Now others paid not the slightest regard
to the edict, for they respected Cicero, and showed him all
manner of kindness and set him on his way: but in
Hipponium, a city of Lucania, which the Romans call
Vibo,<a id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_232_232">232</a> Vibius, a Sicilian, who had derived many advantages
from Cicero’s friendship and had been præfect of the
Fabri during his consulship, would not receive Cicero in
his house, but sent him word that he would assign him a
spot of ground; and Caius Vergilius,<a id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_233_233">233</a> the prætor of Sicily,
who had been most intimate with Cicero, wrote to tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
him to keep away from Sicily. Whereat desponding he
set out for Brundusium, and thence attempted to pass over
to Dyrrachium<a id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_234_234">234</a> with a fair wind; but as it began to blow
against him when he was out at sea, he came back the
day after, and again set sail. It is said that when he had
reached Dyrrachium and was going to land, there was a
shaking of the earth and a violent motion in the sea at
the same time; from which the diviners prognosticated
that his flight would not be lasting, for these were signs
of change. And though many men visited him from good
will and the Greek cities vied in sending deputations to
him, yet he passed his time in despondency<a id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_235_235">235</a> and exceeding
grief, for the most part looking to Italy, like those who
are desperately in love, and in his bearing became very
mean and humbled by reason of his calamity, and so
downcast as no one would have expected from a man who
had spent his life in such philosophical pursuits. And
yet he often asked his friends to call him not an orator, but
a philosopher,<a id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_236_236">236</a> for he said that he had chosen philosophy
as his occupation, but that he employed oratory as an
instrument for his purposes in his public life. But opinion
is powerful to wash out reason from the mind as if it were
dye, and to imprint the affects of the many<a id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_237_237">237</a> by the force of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
intercourse and familiarity on those who engage in public
life, unless a man be strictly on his guard and come in
contact with things external in such wise as to have communion
with the things themselves, not with the affects
towards the things.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="g33"></a> Clodius, after driving out Cicero, burnt his
villas, and burnt his house, and built on the ground a
temple to Liberty: the rest of Cicero’s property<a id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_238_238">238</a> he offered
for sale, and announced it daily, but nobody would buy.
In consequence of these measures being formidable to the
aristocratical party, and dragging along with him the
people, who were let loose to great violence and daring, he
made an attack on Pompeius, ripping up some of the
things that were settled by him in his military command.
By which Pompeius losing some of his reputation blamed
himself for giving up Cicero; and changing again he used
every effort in conjunction with Cicero’s friends to effect
his return. As Clodius resisted this, the Senate resolved
to ratify nothing in the mean time and to do no public
business, unless Cicero was restored. When Lentulus<a id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_239_239">239</a> was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>consul, and the disorder went on increasing so that tribunes
were wounded in the Forum, and Quintus the brother of
Cicero only escaped by lying among the bodies as if he
were dead, the people began to undergo a change of opinion,
and one of the tribunes, Annius Milo, was the first to
venture to bring Clodius to trial for violence, and many
sided with Pompeius both from among the people and the
neighbouring cities. Coming forward with them and
driving Clodius from the Forum, he called the citizens to
the vote: and it is said that the people never confirmed
any measure with so much unanimity. The Senate vying
with the people passed a decree in honour of those cities
which had served Cicero in his exile, and for the restoration<a id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_240_240">240</a>
at the public expense of his house and villas, which
Clodius had destroyed. Cicero was restored in the
sixteenth month<a id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_241_241">241</a> after his exile, and so great was the joy
of the cities and the zeal of all men to meet him, that
what was afterwards said by Cicero fell short of the truth:
for he said that Italy bore him on her shoulders and carried
him into Rome. On which occasion Crassus also, who was
his enemy before his exile, readily met him, and was reconciled
to him, to please his son Publius, as he said, who
was an admirer of Cicero.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="g34"></a> After the lapse of no long time, watching the
opportunity when Clodius was away, Cicero went with a
number of persons to the Capitol and pulled down and
broke the tribunitian tablets<a id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_242_242">242</a> which contained the records
of the administration. When Clodius made this a charge
against him, Cicero said that Clodius had illegally passed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>from the patrician body to the tribunate, and that none of
his acts were valid, at which Cato took offence and spoke
against him, not indeed in commendation of Clodius, but
expressing his mortification at his measures; however he
showed that it was an unusual and violent measure for the
Senate to vote for the rescinding of so many decrees and
acts, among which was his own administration at Cyprus
and Byzantium. This led to a collision between him and
Cicero, which did not proceed to anything open, but the
consequence was that their friendly disposition to one
another was weakened.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="g35"></a> After this Clodius<a id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_243_243">243</a> was killed by Milo, who
being prosecuted for murder got Cicero for his advocate.
But the Senate, being afraid lest there should be some
disturbance in the city on the trial of Milo, who was a
man of high repute and bold spirit, intrusted to Pompeius
the superintendence of this and other trials, and commissioned
him to provide for the security of the city and
of the courts of justice. Pompeius in the night surrounded
the Forum with soldiers on the heights, and Milo, fearing
that Cicero might be disturbed at the unusual sight and
manage his case worse, persuaded him to be carried in a
litter to the Forum and to rest there till the judices met
and the court was formed. But Cicero, as it appears, was
not only without courage in arms, but was timid even
when he commenced speaking, and hardly ceased shaking
and trembling in many trials till his eloquence had reached
its height and attained steadiness. When he was the
advocate of Murena, on his prosecution by Cato, he was
ambitious to surpass Hortensius, who spoke with great
applause, and he took no rest the night before, in
consequence of which exceeding anxiety and wakefulness,
his powers were impaired and he was considered to have
fallen short of his fame. On this occasion when he came</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>
<p>out of the litter to the trial of Milo and saw Pompeius
seated on an elevated place as in a camp and arms flashing
all around the Forum, he was confounded and scarcely
commenced his speech for trembling and hesitation,
though Milo himself bravely and courageously assisted at
the trial and would not deign to let his hair grow or to
change his dress for a dark one, which seems in no small
degree to have contributed to his condemnation. But
Cicero in all this was considered rather to have shown
his attachment to his friend than any cowardice.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="g36"></a> Cicero became also one of the priests, whom
the Romans called Augurs,<a id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_244_244">244</a> in place of the younger
Crassus after his death among the Parthians. The
province of Cilicia<a id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_245_245">245</a> being allotted to him and an army of
twelve thousand legionary soldiers and two thousand six
hundred horse, he set sail with instructions to keep
Cappadocia friendly and obedient to Ariobarzanes.<a id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_246_246">246</a> He
accomplished this, and arranged it without any blame and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>without war; and as he observed that the Cilicians were
inclined to a rising on occasion of the defeat of the Romans
by the Parthians and the movements in Syria, he pacified
them by a mild administration. Nor would he receive
any presents when the kings offered them, and he relieved
the provincials from giving entertainments: and he
himself daily received those who were agreeable to him at
banquets, not in a costly way, but liberally. And there
was no doorkeeper to his house, nor was he ever seen by
any one lying down, but in the morning he would be
standing or walking about in front of his chamber, where
he received those who paid their respects<a id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_247_247">247</a> to him. It is
said that he neither punished any one with rods nor
allowed any man’s garment to be rent, nor vented abuse
in passion, nor inflicted any penalty accompanied with
contumelious treatment. By discovering that much of
the public property was embezzled he enriched the cities,
and he maintained in their civil rights those who made
restoration, without letting them suffer anything
further. He engaged also in a war in which he defeated
the robbers of Mount Amanus, for which he was saluted
by his soldiers with the title of Imperator.<a id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_248_248">248</a> When
Cæcilius<a id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_249_249">249</a> the orator requested Cicero to send him panthers
from Cilicia to Rome for a certain spectacle, Cicero, who was
proud of his exploits, wrote in reply that there were no
panthers in Cilicia, for they had fled into Caria, indignant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>that they were the only things warred upon, while all others
were enjoying peace. On his voyage back from his province
he first put in at Rhodes, and next tarried at Athens with
gladness out of the pleasant recollection of his former
residence. After associating with men the first for
wisdom, and visiting his old friends and intimates and receiving
due honours from Greece, he returned to Rome at
a time when affairs, as if from violent inflammation, were
bursting out into the Civil War.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="g37"></a> In the Senate, when they were proposing to
vote him a triumph, he said that he would more gladly
follow Cæsar in his triumph, if a settlement could be
effected; and he privately gave much advice by writing
to Cæsar, and much by entreating Pompeius, and
attempting to mollify and pacify both of them. But when
things were past remedy, and Cæsar was advancing, and
Pompeius did not stay, but quitted the city with many
men of character, Cicero did not join in this flight, and it
was supposed that he was attaching himself to Cæsar. And
it is plain that in his resolves he was much perplexed both
ways and suffered much; for he says in his letters<a id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_250_250">250</a> that
he did not know which way to turn himself, and that
Pompeius had an honourable and good cause to fight for,
but that Cæsar managed things better and was better able
to save himself and the citizens, so that he knew whom to
fly from, but not whom to fly to. Trebatius, one of Cæsar’s
friends, wrote to the purport, that Cæsar thought that
before all things Cicero ought to put himself on Cæsar’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>side and to share his hopes, but if he declined by reason of
his age, he advised him to go to Greece and there to seat
himself quietly out of the way of both; but Cicero, being
surprised that Cæsar himself did not write, replied in
passion that he would do nothing unworthy of his political
life. What appears in his letters is to this effect.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="g38"></a> When Cæsar had set out to Iberia, Cicero
immediately sailed to Pompeius. The rest were well
pleased that he was come, but Cato on seeing him rated
him in private greatly for joining Pompeius: he said it
was not seemly in himself to desert that line of policy
which he had chosen from the first; but that Cicero, though
he could do more good to his country and his friends if
he remained at Rome an indifferent spectator and shaped
his conduct by the result, without any reason or necessity
had become an enemy of Cæsar and had come there to
share in great danger. These words disturbed the resolve
of Cicero, and also that Pompeius did not employ him in
anything of weight. But he was the cause of this himself,
inasmuch as he made no secret of repenting of what
he had done, and depreciated the resources of Pompeius,
and privately showed his dissatisfaction at his plans, and
abstained not from scoffing and saying any sharp thing
of the allies, though he himself always went about in the
camp without a smile and with sorrowful countenance;
but he gave cause of laughter to others who had no occasion
for it. It is better to mention a few of these things.
Domitius<a id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_251_251">251</a> was placing in a post of command a man of no
warlike turn, and said, How modest he is in his manner
and how prudent; “Why then,” said Cicero, “do you
not keep him to take care of your children?” When
some were commending Theophanes<a id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_252_252">252</a> the Lesbian, who
was a Præfectus of Fabri in the camp, for his excellent
consolation of the Rhodians on the loss of their fleet,
“What a huge blessing it is,” he said, “to have a Greek
Præfect!” When Cæsar was successful in most things
and in a manner was blockading them, he replied to the
remark of Lentulus that he heard that Cæsar’s friends
were dispirited, “You mean to say that they are ill-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>disposed<a id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_253_253">253</a>
to Cæsar?” One Marcius, who had just arrived
from Rome, said that a report prevailed in Rome that
Pompeius was blockaded. “I suppose you sailed hither
then,” said Cicero, “that you might see it with your own
eyes and believe.” After the defeat Nonnius observed
that they ought to have good hopes, for that seven eagles
were left in the camp of Pompeius, “Your advice would
be good,” said Cicero, “if we were fighting with jack-daws.”
When Labienus was relying on certain oracular
answers, and saying that Pompeius must get the victory,
“Yes,” said Cicero, “it is by availing ourselves of such
generalship as this that we have lost the camp.”</p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="g39"></a> After the battle at Pharsalus, in which he
was not present by reason of illness, and when Pompeius
had fled, Cato, who had a large army at Dyrrachium and
a great fleet, asked Cicero to take the command according
to custom, and as he had the superior dignity of the
consulship. But as Cicero rejected the command and altogether
was averse to joining the armament, he narrowly
escaped being killed, for the young Pompeius and his
friends called him a traitor and drew their swords, but
Cato stood in the gap and with difficulty rescued Cicero
and let him go from the army. Having put in at Brundusium
he stayed there waiting for Cæsar, who was
delayed by affairs in Asia and in Egypt. But when
news came that Cæsar was landed at Tarentum<a id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_254_254">254</a>; and was
coming round by land to Brundusium, Cicero went to
him, not being altogether without hope, but feeling shame
in the presence of many persons to make trial of a man
who was his enemy and victorious. However there was
no need for him to do or say anything unworthy of himself;
for when Cæsar saw Cicero coming to meet him at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>a great distance before all the rest, he got down, and
embraced him and talking with him alone walked several
stadia. From this time he continued to show respect to
Cicero and friendly behaviour, so that even in his reply
to Cicero, who had written a panegyric on Cato, he commended
his eloquence and his life, as most resembling
those of Perikles and Theramenes.<a id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_255_255">255</a> Cicero’s discourse was
called Cato, and Cæsar’s was entitled Anticato. It is
said also that when Quintus Ligarius<a id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_256_256">256</a> was under prosecution,
because he had been one of Cæsar’s enemies and
Cicero was his advocate, Cæsar said to his friends, “What
hinders us listening after so long an interval to Cicero’s
speech, since the man has long been adjudged a villain
and an enemy?” But when Cicero had begun to speak
and was making a wonderful sensation, and his speech
as he proceeded was in feeling varied and in grace admirable,
the colour often changed in Cæsar’s face, and it was
manifest that he was undergoing divers emotions in his
mind; but at last when the orator touched upon the battle
at Pharsalus, he was so affected that his body shook and
he dropped some of the writings from his hands. Accordingly
he acquitted the man of the charge perforce.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="g40"></a> After this, as the constitution was changed to a
monarchy, Cicero<a id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_257_257">257</a> detaching himself from public affairs
applied himself to philosophy with such young men as
were disposed; and mainly from his intimacy with the
noblest born and the first in rank, he again got very
great power in the state. His occupation was to compose
philosophical dialogues and to translate and to transfer
into the Roman language every dialectical or physical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>term; for it is he, as they say, who first or mainly formed
for the Romans the terms Phantasia, Syncatathesis,
Epoche, and Catalepsis, and also Atom, and Indivisible,
and Vacuum, and many other like terms, some of which
by metaphor, and others by other modes of assimilation
he contrived to make intelligible and to bring into
common use: and he employed his ready turn for poetry
to amuse himself. For it is said that when he was disposed
that way, he would make five hundred verses in
a night. The greatest part of his time he now spent
in his lands at Tusculum, and he used to write to his
friends that he was living the life of Laertes,<a id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_258_258">258</a> whether
it was that he said this in jest, as his manner was, or
whether from ambition he was bursting with desire to
participate in public affairs and was dissatisfied with
matters as they were. He seldom went down to the
city, and when he did, it was to pay court to Cæsar, and
he was foremost among those who spoke in favour of the
honours given to him and were eager always to be saying
something new about the man and his acts. Of this kind
is what he said about the statues of Pompeius, which
Cæsar ordered to be set up after they had been taken
away and thrown down, and they were set up again. For
Cicero said that by this mild behaviour Cæsar placed the
statues of Pompeius, but firmly fixed his own.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="g41"></a> His intention being, as it is said, to comprehend
in one work the history of his country and to combine
with it much of Greek affairs and in fine to place there
the stories and myths which he had collected, he was
prevented by public and many private affairs contrary to
his wish, and by troubles, most of which seem to have
been of his own causing. For first of all, he divorced his
wife Terentia,<a id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_259_259">259</a> because he had been neglected by her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>during the war, so that he set out in want even of
necessaries for his journey, and did not even on his return
to Italy find her well-disposed to him. For she did not
go to him, though he was staying some time in Brundusium,
and when her daughter, who was a young woman, was
going so long a journey, she did not supply her with suitable
attendance, nor any means, but she even made Cicero’s
house void of everything and empty, besides incurring
many great debts. These are the most decent reasons for
the separation which are mentioned. But Terentia denied
that these were the reasons, and Cicero made her defence
a complete one by marrying no long time after a maid;<a id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_260_260">260</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
as Terentia charged it, through passion for her beauty,
but as Tiro<a id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_261_261">261</a> the freedman of Cicero has recorded it, to
get means for paying his debts. For the young woman
was very rich and Cicero had the care of her property,
being left fiduciary heir. Being in debt to the amount of
many ten thousands he was persuaded by his friends and
relatives to marry the girl, notwithstanding the disparity
of age, and to get rid of his creditors by making use of her
property. But Antonius, who made mention of the
marriage in reply to the Philippics, says that he put out
of doors his wife with whom he had grown old, and at
the same time he made some cutting jibes on the housekeeping
habits of Cicero as a man unfit for action and for
arms. No long time after his marriage Cicero’s daughter
died in child-birth, for she had married Lentulus after
the death of her former husband Piso. The philosophers
from all quarters came together to console Cicero, but he
bore his misfortune very ill, and even divorced his wife
because he thought that she was pleased at the death of
Tullia.<a id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_262_262">262</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>
<p>XLII.<a id="g42"></a><a id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_263_263">263</a> Such were Cicero’s domestic affairs. He had
no share in the design that was forming against Cæsar,
though he was one of the most intimate friends of Brutus
and was supposed to be annoyed at the present state of
affairs and so long for the old state more than anybody
else. But the men feared his temper as being deficient in
daring, and the occasion was one in which courage fails
even the strongest natures. When the deed was accomplished
by the partisans of Brutus and Cassius, and Cæsar’s
friends were combining against the conspirators, and there
was fear of the city again being involved in civil
wars, Antonius, who was consul, brought the Senate
together and said a few words about concord; and Cicero,
after speaking at length and suitably to the occasion,
persuaded the Senate to imitate the Athenians and decree
an amnesty<a id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_264_264">264</a> for what had been done to Cæsar, and to give
provinces to Brutus and Cassius. But none of these
things came to a conclusion. For the people of themselves
being transported to pity, when they saw the corpse
carried through the Forum, and Antonius showed them
the garments filled with blood and slashed in every part
by the swords, maddened by passion sought for the men
in the Forum and ran with fire in their hands to their
houses to burn them. The conspirators escaped the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>danger by being prepared for it, but as they expected
other great dangers, they quitted the city.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="g43"></a> Antonius was forthwith elated, and was formidable
to all, as about to become sole ruler; but to
Cicero most formidable. For Antonius seeing that
Cicero’s power was recovering strength in the State, and
knowing that he was closely allied with Brutus, was
annoyed at his presence. And there existed even before
this some ill-will between them on account of the unlikeness
and difference in their lives. Cicero fearing these
things, first made an attempt to go with Dolabella<a id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_265_265">265</a> to
Syria as legatus: but the consuls for the next year, Irtius
and Pansa,<a id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_266_266">266</a> who were good men and admirers of Cicero,
prayed him not to desert them, and they undertook if he
were present to put down Antonius. Cicero, neither distrusting
altogether nor trusting gave up his design as to
Dolabella, and agreed with Irtius to spend the summer in
Athens, and when they had entered on their office, to
come back, and he sailed off by himself. But as there was
some delay about the voyage, and new reports, as the
wont is, reached him from Rome that Antonius had undergone
a wonderful change, and was doing and administering
everything conformably to the pleasure of the Senate,
and that matters only required his presence to be brought
to the best arrangement, himself blaming his excessive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>caution turned back to Rome. And he was not deceived
in his first expectations, so great a crowd of people through
joy and longing for him poured forth to meet him, and
near a whole day was taken up at the gates and upon his
entrance with greetings and friendly reception. On the
following day Antonius summoned a Senate and invited
Cicero, who did not come, but was lying down pretending
to be indisposed from fatigue. But the truth appeared to
be that he was afraid of some design against him, in consequence
of certain suspicions and of information which
reached him on the road. Antonius was irritated at the
calumny and sent soldiers with orders to bring Cicero or
burn his house, but as many persons opposed Antonius
and urged him by entreaties he took securities only and
desisted. And henceforward they continued to pass by
without noticing one another and to be mutually on their
guard, till the young Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_267_267">267</a> having arrived from Apollonia
took possession of the inheritance of the elder Cæsar, and
came to a quarrel with Antonius about the two thousand
five hundred ten thousands<a id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_268_268">268</a> which Antonius detained of
his substance.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="g44"></a> Upon this, Philippus<a id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_269_269">269</a> who was married to young
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>Cæsar’s mother, and Marcellus, who was married to his
sister, came with the young man to Cicero, and made a
compact that Cicero should lend to Cæsar both in the
Senate and before the people the power that he derived
from his eloquence and his political position, and that
Cæsar should give to Cicero the security that could be
derived from money and from arms. For the young man
had about him many of those who had served under
Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_270_270">270</a> There appeared also to have been some stronger
reason for Cicero readily accepting the friendship of
Cæsar. For, as the story goes, while Pompeius and
Cæsar were living, Cicero dreamed<a id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_271_271">271</a> that some one summoned
the sons of the senators to the Capitol, as Jupiter
was going to appoint one of them chief of Rome, and that
the citizens ran eagerly and placed themselves around the
temple and the youths seated themselves in their prætextæ
in silence. The doors opened suddenly and one by one
the youths rising walked round before the god, who
looked at them all and dismissed them sorrowing. But
when young Cæsar was advancing towards him, the god
stretched out his hand and said, “Romans, there is an end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
to civil wars when this youth becomes your leader.” They
say that Cicero having had such a dream as this had imprinted
on his memory the appearance of the youth and
retained it distinctly, but he did not know him. The
following day as he was going down to the Campus
Martius, the boys who had taken their exercise were
returning, and the youth was then seen by Cicero for the
first time just as he appeared to him in his dream, and
being struck with surprise Cicero asked who were his parents.
Now his father was Octavius, not a man of
very illustrious station, but his mother was Attia, a niece
of Cæsar. Accordingly Cæsar, who had no children of
his own, gave the youth his property and family name by
his will. After this they say that Cicero took pains to
notice the youth when he met him, and the youth received
well his friendly attentions; for it had also happened
that he was born in Cicero’s consulship.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="g45"></a> These were the reasons which were mentioned;
but his hatred of Antonius in the chief place, and then his
disposition, which was governed by ambition, attached
him to Cæsar in the expectation of adding to his own
political influence Cæsar’s power. For the young man
went so far in paying his court to Cicero as to call him
father.<a id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_272_272">272</a> At which Brutus being much annoyed blamed
Cicero in his letters to Atticus, that through fear of
Antonius he was courting Cæsar and was thus manifestly
not procuring liberty for his country, but wooing for
himself a kind master. However Cicero’s son,<a id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_273_273">273</a> who was
studying philosophy at Athens, was engaged by Brutus
and employed in command in many things which he did
successfully. Cicero’s power in the city was then at its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>height, and as he could do what he liked, he drove
Antonius out and raised a faction against him and sent
out the two consuls Irtius and Pansa<a id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_274_274">274</a> to fight against him,
and he persuaded the Senate by a vote to give Cæsar
lictors and the insignia of a prætor, as if he were fighting
in defence of their country. But when Antonius had
been defeated and on the death of the two consuls after
the battle the forces joined Cæsar, and the Senate through
fear of a youth who had enjoyed splendid success was
attempting by honours and gifts to call away from him
the armies, and to divide his power, on the ground that
there was no need of troops to defend the state now that
Antonius was fled, under these circumstances Cæsar being
alarmed secretly sent messengers to Cicero, to entreat and
urge Cicero to get the consulship for the two, but to
manage matters as he thought best, and to have the
power, and to direct the young man who was only desirous
of a name and reputation. And Cæsar himself admitted
that it was through fear of his troops being disbanded
and the danger of being left alone, that he had
availed himself in a time of need of Cicero’s love of power
by urging him to take the consulship, and promising that
he would act with him and assist in the canvass at the
same time.</p>
<p>XLVI.<a id="g46"></a> In this way indeed Cicero being very greatly
pushed on, he an old man by a young one, and cajoled,
assisted at the canvass of Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_275_275">275</a> and got the Senate in his
favour, for which he was blamed by his friends at the
time, and he shortly after saw that he had ruined himself
and betrayed the liberty of the people. For when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>youth was strengthened and had got the consulship, he
gave himself no concern about Cicero, but making friends
with Antonius and Lepidus<a id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_276_276">276</a> and uniting his forces with
theirs, he divided the chief power with them, just as if
it were a piece of property. And a list of above two
hundred men was made out, who were doomed to die.
The proscription of Cicero caused most dispute among
them in their discussions, for Antonius was not inclined
to come to any terms unless Cicero was the first to be
doomed to death, and Lepidus sided with Antonius, but
Cæsar held out against both. They held their meeting by
themselves in secret near the city Bononia<a id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_277_277">277</a> for three days,
and they met in a place at some distance from the camps
which was surrounded by a river. It is said that during
the first two days Cæsar struggled in behalf of Cicero,
but that he yielded on the third and gave up the man. And
the matter of their mutual surrender was thus. Cæsar was
to give up Cicero, and Lepidus his brother Paulus,<a id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_278_278">278</a> and
Antonius was to give up Lucius Cæsar, who was his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>uncle on the mother’s side. So far did they through
resentment and rage throw away all human feeling, or
rather they showed that no animal is more savage than
man when he has gotten power added to passion.</p>
<p>XLVII.<a id="g47"></a><a id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_279_279">279</a> While this was going on, Cicero was on his
lands at Tusculum, and his brother with him; and on
hearing of the proscriptions they determined to remove
to Astura,<a id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_280_280">280</a> a place belonging to Cicero on the sea-coast,
and thence to sail to Macedonia to Brutus, for there was
already a rumour about him that he had a force. They
were conveyed in litters, being worn out by grief; and
halting by the way and placing their litters side by side
they lamented to one another. Quintus<a id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_281_281">281</a> was the more
desponding, and he began to reflect on his needy condition,
for he said that he had brought nothing from home;
and indeed Cicero was but scantily provided for his
journey; it was better then, he said, for Cicero to hurry
on in his flight, and for him to hasten back and to provide
himself from home with what he wanted. This was
agreed, and embracing one another with tears they separated.
Now Quintus, not many days after, was betrayed
by his slaves to those who were in search of him and put
to death with his son. Cicero arrived at Astura, and
finding a vessel he immediately embarked, and sailed
along the coast to Circæum,<a id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_282_282">282</a> the wind in his favour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span></p><p>When the sailors were wishing to set sail immediately
from thence, whether it was that he feared the sea, or had
not quite despaired of all trust in Cæsar, he landed, and
went on foot about a hundred stadia on the road to Rome.
But again perplexed and changing his mind he went
down to the sea of Astura; and there he spent the night
in dreadful and desperate reflections, so that he even
formed a design to get secretly into Cæsar’s house, and
by killing himself on the hearth to fasten on him an
avenging dæmon. But the fear of tortures drove him
from this measure also; and after perplexing himself
with other schemes and shifting from one to another,
he put himself in the hands of his slaves to convey him
by sea to Capitæ,<a id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_283_283">283</a> for he had lands there and a place
of retreat which was very agreeable in summer, when the
Etesian winds blow most softly. The place has also a
temple of Apollo, a little above the sea. A flock of crows
winging their flight from thence with loud cawing
approached the vessel of Cicero as it was rowing to land,
and settling at each end of the sail-yard some made a
noise, and others gnawed the end of the ropes, and all
were of opinion that the omen was bad. Cicero landed,
and going to the villa he lay down to rest. But most of
the crows perched themselves on different parts of the
window, cawing clamorously; and one of them, going down
to the couch where Cicero lay wrapped up, by degrees
removed with its beak the covering from his face. The
slaves seeing this, and considering it a reproach to them
if they should wait to be spectators of their master’s
murder, while even brute beasts came to his aid and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
cared for him in his unmerited misfortune, but they
themselves were giving no help, partly by entreaty,
partly using force, took him up and carried him in a
litter towards the sea.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="g48"></a> In the meantime the murderers with their
helpers came on, Herennius<a id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_284_284">284</a> a centurion, and Popilius a
tribune, who had once been prosecuted for parricide
and Cicero was his advocate. Finding the doors closed
they broke them open, and as Cicero was not seen and
those who were within denied that they knew where he
was, it is said that a youth who had been brought up by
Cicero in liberal studies and learning, and was a freedman
of Cicero’s brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the
tribune that the litter was being conveyed through the
wooded and shady paths to the sea. Accordingly the
tribune, taking a few men with him, ran round to the outlet.
And as Herennius was running along the paths,
Cicero saw him and bade the slaves place down the litter
there; and, as his wont was, holding his chin with his
left hand he looked steadily on the murderers, being all
squalid and unshorn, and his countenance wasted by care,
so that most of them covered their faces while Herennius
was killing him. He stretched his neck<a id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_285_285">285</a> out of the litter
and was killed, being then in his sixty-fourth year.
Herennius cut off his head and the hands, pursuant to the
command of Antonius, with which he wrote the Philippics.
For Cicero himself entitled Philippics the speeches which
he wrote against Antonius, and to the present day they
are called Philippics.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="g49"></a> When the head and hands<a id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_286_286">286</a> were brought to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>Rome, Antonius happened to be holding an election of
magistrates, and when he heard the news and saw what
had been done, he called out that the proscriptions were
now at an end. He ordered the head and hands to be
placed above the Rostra on the place whence the orators
spoke, a sight that made the Romans shudder, who thought
that they saw, not the face of Cicero, but an image of the
soul of Antonius. Still he showed herein one sentiment
of just dealing, for he delivered up Philologus to Pomponia
the wife of Quintus, who having got him into her power,
inflicted terrible vengeance upon him, and among other
things compelled him to cut off his flesh bit by bit, and to
roast and eat it. Thus some of the historians have told
the story, but Tiro, who was Cicero’s freedman, makes no
mention at all of the treachery of Philologus.<a id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_287_287">287</a> I have
heard that Cæsar a long time after once went to see one of
his daughter’s sons,<a id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_288_288">288</a> and as the youth had in his hands one
of Cicero’s writings, he was afraid and hid it in his vest;
the which Cæsar observing took the book and read a good
part of it while he was standing, and then returning the
book to the boy said, “A wise man, my boy, a wise man
and a lover of his country.” As soon as Cæsar had finally
defeated Antonius, he took Cicero’s son<a id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_289_289">289</a> to be his colleague
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]<br>[Pg 210]</a></span>
in the consulship, in whose magistracy the Senate threw
down the statues of Antonius and destroyed all other
testimonials in honour of him, and further decreed that
no Antonius should bear the name of Marcus. That
the dæmon reserved for the family of Cicero the final
vengeance on Antonius.</p>

<h2>COMPARISON OF DEMOSTHENES
AND CICERO.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="h1"></a> The above is all I have been able to find out that is
worth being recorded about Demosthenes and Cicero. Without
attempting to compare their different styles of oratory,
I think it necessary to remark that Demosthenes devoted
all his powers, natural and acquired, to the study of
eloquence alone, so that he surpassed all his rivals in
the law courts and public assembly in perspicuity and
ability, all the writers of declamations in splendour and
pomp of diction, and all the professional sophists in
accuracy and scientific method. Cicero, on the other
hand, was a man of great learning and various literary
accomplishments. He wrote a considerable number of
philosophic treatises modelled on the works of the
Academic school, and in all his forensic and political
speeches we can detect a desire to let his audience know
that he was a man of letters. In their speeches, too, we
can discern the impress of their respective characters.
The eloquence of Demosthenes never stoops to jest, and
is utterly without ornament, but has a terrible concentrated
earnestness, which does not smell of the lamp, as
Pytheas sneeringly said, but which reminds us of the
ungenial, painstaking, acrimonious nature of the man:
while Cicero often is carried by his love of jesting to the
verge of buffoonery, and in his pleadings treats serious
matters in a tone of most unbecoming levity and flippancy,
as in the oration for Cæcilius he argues that in an age of such
luxury and extravagance there can be nothing to wonder
at if a man takes his pleasure; for not to help oneself to
the pleasures which are within one’s reach is the part of
a madman, seeing that the most eminent philosophers
have declared the chief felicity of man to consist <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>in
pleasure. It is related that when Cato prosecuted Murena,
Cicero, who was consul at the time, defended him, and
cracked many jokes on Cato as an adherent of the Stoic
philosophy, and on the absurdity of the paradoxes which
it maintains. The audience, and even the judges, laughed
heartily; but Cato merely remarked to those near him,
with a quiet smile, “Gentlemen, what a witty consul we
have.” Cicero, indeed, seems to have been fond of
laughter and mirth, and his countenance was calm and
smiling; while that of Demosthenes always bore the
marks of gloomy, anxious thought, which caused his
enemies, as he himself tells us, to call him disagreeable
and ill-natured.</p>
<p>II.<a id="h2"></a> In their speeches we may observe that Demosthenes
praises himself with great moderation, in a manner which
can offend no one, and only when he has some more
important object in view, while he is usually modest and
cautious in his language; whereas Cicero’s show a ridiculous
amount of egotism and craving for applause, when,
he demands that “arms shall yield to the toga, and the
triumphal laurel<a id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_290_290">290</a> give place to his tongue.” At last
he took to praising not only his own deeds, but even his
spoken and written<a id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_291_291">291</a> orations, as though he were engaged
in some contest with professional rhetoricians like Isokrates
or Anaximenes, rather than endeavouring to lead and
reform the Roman people—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Savage and rude, whose sole delight</div>
<div class="line">Was with their foes to strive in fight.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>A politician must of necessity be a powerful speaker, but
it is a contemptible thing for him to be too greedy and
covetous of applause for his fine speeches. Wherefore, in
this respect Demosthenes appears far graver, and of a
nobler nature; for he himself declared that his eloquence
came only by practice, and depended on the favour of his
audience, and that he regarded those who boasted of their
oratorical powers as vulgar and despicable characters.</p>
<p>III.<a id="h3"></a> They were both alike in their power and influence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>with the people, which caused even the commanders of
armies in the field to look to them for support; for Demosthenes
was courted by Chares, Diopeithes, and Leosthenes,
as was Cicero by Pompeius and the younger Cæsar,<a id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_292_292">292</a> as
Cæsar himself admits in his memoirs addressed to Mæcenas
and Agrippa. We cannot judge of Demosthenes by that
which is said to afford the most certain test of a man’s
true character—his conduct when in power—for he has
not afforded us any opportunity of doing so, as he would
not even take the command of the confederacy which he
himself organised to oppose Philip. Now Cicero was sent
to Sicily as quæstor, and to Cilicia and Cappadocia as
proconsul, at a period when the love of wealth was at
its height, and when the Roman generals and governors,
thinking it beneath them to steal money, used to resort
to open robbery. It was not thought discreditable to
plunder a province, but he who did so with moderation
was esteemed as an excellent governor. Cicero on these
occasions gained great credit by the many proofs which
he gave of indifference to money, and of goodness and
kindness of heart. At Rome itself also, he was elected
nominally consul, but really dictator with unlimited
powers to deal with Catilina’s conspiracy, and he then
proved the truth of Plato’s aphorism, that a state finds
rest from its misfortunes when by good luck a powerful
and able man is found to rule it with justice. Demosthenes
again is said to have made money dishonourably
by writing speeches for other men, as in the case of the
speeches with which he secretly furnished Phormio and
Apollodorus, when they were opposed to one another.
He also was suspected of receiving bribes from the King
of Persia, and was caught in the act of taking a bribe
from Harpalus. Even if we suppose these charges, supported
as they are by the testimony of so many writers,
to be false, yet it is impossible to deny that Demosthenes,
who trafficked in that peculiarly discreditable form of
usury, marine insurances,<a id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_293_293">293</a> would not have been able to
refuse a present offered in all honour by a king, while we
have already related how Cicero refused to take money
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>from the Sicilians when he was quæstor,<a id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_294_294">294</a> and from the
Cappadocians when he was proconsul, and even from his
friends, who pressed him to accept large sums when he
was exiled from Rome.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="h4"></a> Moreover, Demosthenes was exiled in great disgrace,
after he had been convicted of having received a
bribe, while Cicero’s banishment was the consequence of
the noblest action of his life, the ridding his country of
wicked men. Wherefore, no one could plead for Demosthenes
when he left the country, but the Senate publicly
put on mourning for Cicero, grieved for his absence, and
refused to transact any business before voting that he
should be restored to Rome. Yet Cicero spent his exile
idly in Macedonia, while Demosthenes carried out an
important part of his policy while in exile; for, as has
been related, he accompanied the Athenian embassy to
the various states of Greece, discomfited the Macedonian
ambassadors, and proved himself a far better citizen than
Themistokles or Alkibiades under similar circumstances:
moreover, after his restoration to Athens, he continued to
pursue the same policy of unceasing opposition to Antipater
and the Macedonians, while Lælius reproached
Cicero for sitting silent in the senate-house when young
Octavius Cæsar, before his beard was grown, petitioned
to be allowed to sue for the consulship in spite of the
law. Brutus also blamed him for having fostered a
greater and harsher tyranny than that which he put
down.</p>
<p>V.<a id="h5"></a> In conclusion, we must regard the death of Cicero
as most pitiable, that an old man, through cowardice,
should be carried hither and thither by his slaves, seeking
to escape death, and hiding himself from his foes, although
he could in any case have but a short time to live, and
then be murdered after all; while Demosthenes, though
he did beg somewhat for his life, must be admired for his
forethought in providing himself with the poison, and
also for the use which he made of it, to escape from the
cruelty of Antipater even when surrounded by his soldiers,
and to betake himself to a greater sanctuary, as that of
the god was unable to protect him.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF DEMETRIUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="i1"></a> He who first compared the arts to our senses seems
to me to have especially alluded to the power which they
both exhibit of dealing with objects of completely contrary
qualities. In this respect they coincide; but they
differ in respect of the use and purpose of the object of
which they take cognisance. Our senses are influenced
indifferently by things white or black, sweet or bitter,
soft or hard, for the proper function of each sense is
merely to receive all these impressions and to convey
them to the mind. But the arts, which have been invented
in order to cultivate the qualities proper to their
own nature and to eschew those which are foreign to it,
view some with especial favour, as partaking of their own
essence, and avoid others as mere untoward accidents.
Thus the art of medicine deals with diseases and the art
of music deals with discord merely with a view to
produce their respective opposites; while self-control,
justice and wisdom, which are the most perfect of all arts,
because they decide not only what is honourable, righteous
and useful but likewise what is hurtful, shameful, and
unjust, do not praise innocency which prides itself upon
inexperience of evil, but think it to be folly and ignorance
of what all who intend to live as becomes them ought to
know. The ancient Spartans at their feasts used to compel
their helots to drink a large quantity of wine, and
then brought them into the banqueting-hall, in order to
show the young Spartans what drunkenness was like. I
think that to instruct one class of men by the ruin of
another is neither humane nor politic, yet I conceive that
it may be useful to insert among my Parallel Lives some
examples of men who have been careless of their <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>own
reputation, and who have used their great place and
power only to make themselves notorious for evil. The
description of such men’s lives is not indeed an agreeable
task, or a pleasant mode of employing my leisure, still, as
Ismenias the Theban, when instructing his scholars how
to play the flute, used to say, “Thus you should play;”
and again, “Thus you should not play,” while Antigenides
even thought that the young would take more pleasure
in listening to good flute-players, if they had first heard
bad ones, so I think that we shall be more inclined both
to admire and to imitate the lives of good men, if we are
well acquainted with those of bad ones. This book, then,
will contain the lives of Demetrius, surnamed the City-taker,
and of Antonius the Triumvir, men who bear signal
witness to the truth of Plato’s remark, that great men
have great vices as well as great virtues. Both alike
loved passionately, drank deep, and fought bravely; both
were freehanded, extravagant and arrogant. Fortune
served them both alike, not only in their lives, for each
of them had great successes and great disasters, each won
great empire and lost it again, each unexpectedly fell
and rose again; but also in their deaths, as the one was
captured by his enemies, and the same fate all but befell
the other.</p>
<p>II.<a id="i2"></a> Antigonus<a id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_295_295">295</a> had two sons by Stratonike the
daughter of Korragus, one of whom he named Demetrius
after his brother, and the other Philip after his father.
This is the account given by most historians, though
some say that Demetrius was not the son, but the nephew,
of Antigonus; but that, as his father died while he was
still an infant and his mother at once married Antigonus,
he was commonly regarded as his son. His brother
Philip, who was a few years younger than himself, died
soon, but Demetrius grew up to be a tall man, though
not so tall as his father. His face and figure were of extraordinary
beauty, which baffled all the attempts of painters
and sculptors to do it justice. His expression was at once
sweet, commanding and terrible; and his countenance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>showed all the eagerness and fire of youth combined with
the calm dignity of a hero and a king. In like manner
his disposition was one which was equally capable of
inspiring terror or love. He was the pleasantest of
companions, more given to wine-drinking and the enjoyment
of luxurious idleness than any other king of his age,
and yet he displayed remarkable energy and persistence
in action; so that he emulated the fame of the god
Dionysus,<a id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_296_296">296</a> being like him a famous warrior, and when
the war was over most capable of thoroughly enjoying the
arts of peace.</p>
<p>III.<a id="i3"></a> He was remarkably fond of his father; and the
love and respect which he paid to his father and mother
seem to have been prompted by true affection, not by a
wish to stand well with those in power. Once when
Antigonus was receiving an embassy from some foreign
state, Demetrius, who had been out hunting, came up to
his father, kissed him, and sat down beside him just as he
was, with his javelins still in his hand. When the
ambassadors had transacted their business and were about
to leave his presence, Antigonus said to them in a loud
voice, “And, gentlemen, you may carry home this news
about me and my son, that these are the terms on which
we live,” thinking that so great a proof of his trust in his
son’s loyalty would add considerable strength to his throne.
So much mistrust and suspicion is bred by absolute power,
and so hard a thing is it for a king to have a companion,
that the eldest and greatest of the successors of Alexander
publicly boasted that he was not afraid to have his own
son sitting by his side with a spear in his hand. Indeed,
this was the only royal family which through many
generations remained unpolluted by this species of crime,
for of all the successors of Antigonus only one, Philip,
assassinated his son. All the records of other dynasties
are full of murders of sons, mothers and wives; for the
murder of brothers had grown to be considered, like an
axiom in mathematics, as a necessary precaution to be
taken by all kings on ascending to the throne.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="i4"></a> The following anecdote seems to prove that
Demetrius when young was of a kind and loving nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Mithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes, was his friend and
companion, and was a good subject of Antigonus, of
thorough and unsuspected loyalty, but at length incurred
the suspicion of Antigonus in consequence of a dream.
Antigonus dreamed that he walked over a large and fair
plain, sowing it with gold dust; and that shortly afterwards,
returning that way again, he found nothing but
stubble left. While grieving over this he heard some
men say that Mithridates had gone away to Pontus on
the Euxine, after having gathered the golden harvest.
Antigonus was much disturbed at this vision, and after
having compelled his son to swear that he would keep
silence about it, told him of the vision, and added that he
had made up his mind to make away with the man.
Demetrius was greatly grieved at hearing this, and when
the young man, as he was wont to do, again joined him,
and spent the day with him, Demetrius dared not tell him
by word of mouth what danger he was in, because of the
oath; but he drew him aside into a quiet place, and there,
as soon as they were alone together, he wrote on the ground
with the but-end of his spear, in sight of the other, the
words “Fly, Mithridates!” Mithridates understood his
meaning, and ran away that very night to Cappadocia.
Not long afterwards, he showed Antigonus what was the
real meaning of his dream; for he made himself master of
an extensive territory, and became the founder of the
dynasty of the kings of Pontus, which was overthrown by
the Romans in about the eighth generation after him.
By this example we may perceive the noble and loyal
nature of Demetrius.</p>
<p>V.<a id="i5"></a> As the elements, because of their mutual attraction
and repulsion, are, according to Empedokles, always at
variance with one another, and especially with those with
which they happen to be in contact, so, while all the
successors of Alexander were always at war, circumstances
from time to time caused hostilities between two or more
of them to take an especially active form. At this time
Antigonus was at war with Ptolemy, and, hearing that
Ptolemy had left the island of Cyprus, had landed in
Syria and was ravaging that country, he himself remained
in Phrygia, but sent his son Demetrius to oppose him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Demetrius was now two and twenty years of age, and
was now for the first time entrusted with the sole management
of an important campaign. As might be expected
of so young and untried a commander, when pitted against
a man trained to war under Alexander, and who had
since his death waged many wars with success, Demetrius
was defeated near the city of Gaza with a loss of fifteen
thousand killed and eight thousand prisoners. He also
lost his own tent, his property, and all his personal
attendants. These, however, were restored to him, with
all his captured friends, by Ptolemy, who sent him a
kindly-worded message to the effect that they ought not
to fight as mortal foes, but only for honour and empire.</p>
<p>Demetrius, after receiving this message and his property,
prayed to the gods that he might not long remain in
Ptolemy’s debt, but that he might soon recompense him
in like manner. He did not behave himself like a youth
who has received a check at the outset of his first campaign,
but repaired his failure like an old and wary
commander, enrolling fresh soldiers, providing new
supplies of arms, keeping a firm hold over the cities near
him and carefully drilling his new levies.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="i6"></a> Antigonus when he heard of the defeat remarked
that Ptolemy had conquered beardless boys, but that
he would have to fight his next battle with grown men.
He yielded however to his son’s entreaty to be allowed
to repair his fault by himself, and, as he did not wish
to damp his spirits, left him in sole command. Soon
after this Killes, Ptolemy’s lieutenant, arrived in Syria
with a large force, meaning to chase Demetrius, whom
he supposed to be disheartened by his defeat, quite
out of Syria. But Demetrius by a sudden attack surprised
his army and struck it with panic. He captured
the enemy’s camp and their general, and took
eight thousand prisoners and a great quantity of booty.
He was overjoyed at this, not because he meant to
keep what he had won, but to give it back, and did
not so much value the glory and wealth which he
had gained as the opportunity now offered him for
repaying the courtesy of Ptolemy. He did not presume
to do this on his own responsibility, but wrote first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
to his father. On receiving permission from him to deal
as he pleased with the fruits of his victory, he gave
costly presents to Killes and his friends, and sent them
back to Ptolemy. This battle forced Ptolemy to retire
from Syria, and brought Antigonus from Kelænæ rejoicing
at the victory and eager to see his son.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="i7"></a> After this Demetrius was sent to subdue the
Nabathean Arabs, in performing which service he incurred
great danger by journeying through waterless deserts;
but his intrepid courage overawed the barbarians, and
he returned loaded with plunder, having captured seven
hundred camels.</p>
<p>Seleukus had once lost his capital city, Babylon, which
Antigonus took from him; but he had since recovered it by
his own arms, and at this time was marching with an army
to attempt the conquest of the nations bordering upon
India, and the provinces near mount Caucasus. Demetrius,
hoping that he might find Mesopotamia in a defenceless
condition, suddenly crossed the Euphrates, took Babylon
by surprise, and made himself master of one of its two
citadels, driving out the garrison placed there by Seleukus.
Demetrius placed seven thousand of his own troops in the
citadel, ordered his troops to enrich themselves by the
plunder of the surrounding country, and then returned
to the sea-coast, leaving Seleukus more firmly established
on his throne than before; for by plundering the country
he seemed to admit that he had no claim to it. As
Ptolemy was now besieging Halikarnassus, he quickly
marched thither and succeeded in saving the city.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="i8"></a> As the glory which he won by this action was
very great, he and his father Antigonus conceived a
strong desire to liberate the whole of Greece from the
tyranny of Ptolemy and Kassander. None of the successors
of Alexander ever waged a more just or honourable
war than this; for Demetrius and Antigonus, to gain
themselves honour by freeing the Greeks, spent upon
them the treasure which they had won in their victories
over the barbarians. They determined first of all to
attack Athens, and when one of the friends of Antigonus
advised him, if he captured that city, to keep it in his
own hands because it was the key of Greece, Antigonus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
replied that the best key to a country was the goodwill
of its people, and that Athens was the watch-tower of the
world, from whence the glory of his deeds should shine
like a beacon-light to all mankind.</p>
<p>Demetrius now set sail for Athens with five thousand
talents of silver, and a fleet of two hundred and fifty
vessels. At this time Demetrius of Phalerum governed the
city as Kassander’s lieutenant, and a garrison was placed
in Munychia. By good fortune and good management the
fleet arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the month Thargelion,
without anyone being aware of its coming. When
the ships were seen, they were thought to form part of
Ptolemy’s fleet, and preparations were made to give them
a friendly reception. At last the officers in command
discovered their mistake, and a scene of great confusion
ensued, as they hastily made preparations to resist the
enemy, who were already in the act of disembarking; for
Demetrius, finding the mouths of the harbours open, sailed
straight in, and could be seen distinctly by all standing
on the deck of the ship, and making signs to the Athenians
to be quiet and keep silence. When this was done, he
bade a herald proclaim that his father Antigonus had sent
him thither in an auspicious hour to liberate the Athenians,
drive out their Macedonian garrison, and restore to them
their own laws and ancient constitution.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="i9"></a> Upon hearing this proclamation the greater part of
the people laid down their shields at their feet, clapped
their hands, and shouted to Demetrius to come ashore, calling
him their saviour and benefactor; while Demetrius of
Phalerum thought it necessary to admit so powerful a man
to the city, even though he might have no intention of
performing any of his promises. He therefore sent
ambassadors to make their submission. Demetrius received
them graciously and sent back with them Aristodemus of
Miletus, one of his father’s friends. As the Phalerean, in
consequence of this sudden turn of fortune, was more afraid
of his own countrymen than of the enemy, Demetrius, who
admired his courage and public spirit, took care to have
him conveyed in safety to Thebes, to which town he
himself wished to go. Demetrius himself now declared
that, although he was very eager to view the city, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>he
would not do so until he had completely set it free and
expelled its garrison. He therefore surrounded Munychia
with a ditch and rampart, cutting it off from the rest of
the city, and then sailed to attack Megara, which town
was held by a garrison of Kassander’s troops.</p>
<p>As he heard that Kratesipolis, the wife of Alexander the
son of Polysperchon, a celebrated beauty, was at Patræ,
and was not unwilling to grant him an interview, he
left his army encamped in the territory of Megara and
proceeded thither with only a few lightly equipped
followers. When he was near the place, he pitched his
own tent apart from his men, that the lady might not be
seen when she came to visit him. Some of the enemy discovered
this, and made a sudden attack upon him. He
only escaped by putting on a mean cloak and running
away alone; so that his licentiousness very nearly exposed
him to ignominious capture. When Megara was
taken the soldiers were about to plunder the city, but the
Athenians with great difficulty prevailed upon Demetrius
to spare it. He drove out the Macedonian garrison and
made the city independent. While he was doing this he
remembered Stilpon the philosopher, who was reputed to
have chosen for himself a life of retirement and study.
Demetrius sent for him, and inquired whether anything
had been stolen from him. “Nothing,” replied Stilpon.
“I saw no one taking away any knowledge.” As, however,
nearly all the slaves were stolen, after Demetrius had
talked graciously to Stilpon and at length dismissed him
with the words, “My Stilpon, I leave you a free city;”
“Quite true,” replied Stilpon, “for you have not left us a
single slave.”</p>
<p>X.<a id="i10"></a> Demetrius now returned to Munychia, encamped
before it, dislodged the garrison, and demolished the fort.
And now at the invitation of the Athenians he proceeded
into the city, where he assembled the people and re-established
the ancient constitution. He also promised
that his father Antigonus would send them one hundred
and fifty thousand bushels of wheat and timber enough to
build a fleet of one hundred ships of war. Thus did the
Athenians recover their democratic constitution fifteen
years after it had been dissolved; for during the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>period
between the Lamian war and the battle of Krannon their
government had nominally been an oligarchy, but practically
had been a despotism, on account of the great power
of Demetrius of Phalerum.</p>
<p>The benefits which Demetrius conferred upon the Athenians
rendered him indeed great and glorious; but they
rendered his fame invidious by the extravagant honours
which they conferred upon him. They were the first of
all men who bestowed upon Antigonus and Demetrius the
title of Kings, a name which they greatly disliked because
of its association, and which moreover belonged at that
time in an especial manner to the descendants of Philip
and Alexander, being the only one of their ensigns of
royalty which had not been adopted by other princes.
The Athenians too were the only people who styled
Antigonus and Demetrius their saviour gods, and they
even abolished the ancient office of the archon from whom
the year received its name, and elected in his place every
year a priest to minister at the altar of the saviour
gods. They also decreed that their images should be
woven into the sacred peplus of Athena,<a id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_297_297">297</a> with those of
the gods. They consecrated the spot where Demetrius
first set his foot on the ground when he alighted from his
chariot, and built an altar upon it which was called the
altar of “The Descending Demetrius.” They added two
to the number of their tribes, and called them Demetrias
and Antigonis; and consequently they raised the number
of the senators from five to six hundred, because each
tribe supplied it with fifty members.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="i11"></a> But the most outrageous of these devices of Stratokles,
for it was he who invented all these new extravagancies
of adulation, was a decree that ambassadors sent
to Antigonus or to Demetrius should wear the same holy
title which had hitherto been given to the envoys who
conducted the public sacrifices to the great festivals at
Olympia and at Delphi. Indeed, in all other respects
Stratokles was a man of shameless effrontery and
debauched life, who appeared to imitate the scurrility of
Kleon in ancient times by the reckless contempt with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>which he treated the people. He publicly kept a courtesan
named Phylakion; and one day when she had
bought some necks and brains in the market, he said to
her, “Why, you have bought us the same things for
dinner which we politicians play at ball with.”</p>
<p>When the Athenians were defeated in the great sea-fight
at Amorgos, he reached Athens before the news of the
disaster, and drove though the Kerameikus with a garland
on his head, telling all the people that a victory had been
won. He decreed a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and had
meat publicly distributed among the tribes for entertainments.
Shortly afterwards the scattered ships began to
arrive, coming home as well as they could after the defeat.
When the people angrily turned upon him, resenting the
trick which he had played them, he met their clamour
with the utmost impudence, and said, “What harm have
I done you, in giving you two days of happiness?” Such
was the audacity of Stratokles.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="i12"></a> There were, however, other marks of servility,
“hotter than fire,” as Aristophanes calls it. One Athenian
surpassed Stratokles himself by passing a decree that
Demetrius, whenever he visited Athens, should be received
with the same divine honours which were paid to Demeter
and Dionysius, and that money should be granted from
the public treasury to the person who should celebrate
the festival of the reception with the greatest magnificence,
in order that with it he might erect some memorial
of his success. At last the name of the month Munychion
was changed to Demetrion, and the first day of it named
Demetrias, while the name of the festival of the Dionysia
was changed to Demetria.</p>
<p>Most of these acts produced manifest signs of the displeasure
of the gods. The peplus, upon which, according
to the decree, the images of Zeus and Athena were woven
together with those of Antigonus and Demetrius, was
rent in two by a violent gust of wind as it was being
conveyed in procession through the Kerameikus, while
a great quantity of hemlock grew up round the altars
which were erected in their honour, although it was not
a common plant in the neighbourhood. On the day of
the festival of Dionysius the procession was put a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>stop
to by excessive cold, which came entirely out of season,
and a severe frost not only destroyed all the fig-trees and
vines, but even cut off a great part of the corn in the
blade. In consequence of this, Philippides, who was an
enemy of Stratokles, made the following allusion to him
in one of his comedies:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Who was it caused the peplus to be rent?</div>
<div class="line">Who was it caused the frost to blight our vines?</div>
<div class="line">The wretch, who worships mortals like to gods,</div>
<div class="line">His crimes destroy us, not my harmless rhymes?”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>This Philippides was a friend of Lysimachus, who for
his sake conferred many benefits on the Athenians. Lysimachus
imagined that the sight of Philippides before any
campaign or expedition was a certain omen of good luck;
while Philippides was beloved by him on other grounds,
because he gave no trouble and never veiled his thoughts
in courtly periphrases. Once Lysimachus, meaning to
be very civil to him said, “Philippides, which of my
possessions shall I bestow upon you?” “Whichever you
please,” answered he, “except your secrets.” I have
mentioned these incidents in the life of Philippides, in
order to mark the distinction between the comic poet and
the mob-orator.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="i13"></a> The most extraordinary of all the honours conferred
upon Demetrius was the proposal made by Demokleides
of Sphettus to go and ask for an oracular response
from him about the consecration of the shields at Delphi.
I will write down the exact words of the law as it was
proposed. “In a happy hour the people decree that one
man shall be chosen from the citizens of Athens, who
shall go to our saviour, and after he has done sacrifice
unto him, shall ask Demetrius, our saviour, in what
manner the people may, with greatest holiness and without
delay, make consecration of their offerings; and
whatever oracle it shall please him to give them, the
people shall perform it.” By this absurd flattery the
intellect of Demetrius, at no time very powerful, was
thrown completely off its balance.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="i14"></a> While he was living at Athens he married
Eurydike, a descendant of the ancient hero Miltiades,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
who was the widow of Opheltas, King of Cyrene, and
had returned to Athens after her husband’s death. The
Athenians were greatly delighted at this marriage, which
they regarded as an honour to their city; though Demetrius
made no sort of difficulty about marriage, and had
many wives at the same time. The chief of his wives,
and the one whom he most respected, was Phila, the
daughter of Antipater, and the widow of Kraterus, who
was the most popular with the Macedonians of all the
successors of Alexander during his life, and the most
lamented by them after his death. Demetrius when
very young was forced by his father to marry this
woman, who was too old to be a suitable match for him.
It is said that when Demetrius expressed his unwillingness
to marry her, his father whispered in his ear the line
of Euripides:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“To gain a fortune, marriage must be dared.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>substituting the word “marriage” for “bondage,” which
occurs in the original. However, the respect which
Demetrius paid to her and to his other wives did not
prevent his intriguing with various courtesans and
mistresses, but he had a worse reputation in this respect
than any other king of his age.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="i15"></a> His father now ordered him to proceed to Cyprus,
and to attack Ptolemy, who was in possession of that
island. He was forced to obey this summons, but as he
was very unwilling to desist from the war in defence of
the liberties of Greece, a much more noble and glorious
struggle, he first endeavoured to bribe Ptolemy’s lieutenant
in command of the garrison of Sikyon and Corinth to
evacuate those cities and render them independent. As
this attempt failed he quickly set sail, collected a large
force, and proceeded to Cyprus. Here he fought a battle
with Menelaus, Ptolemy’s brother, and at once defeated
him. Shortly afterwards Ptolemy himself came to Cyprus
with an immense fleet and army. The two commanders
now interchanged messages of scornful defiance. Ptolemy
bade Demetrius put to sea before his own host assembled
and overwhelmed him, while Demetrius offered to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>permit
Ptolemy to withdraw from Cyprus on condition that he
would give up Corinth and Sikyon. The battle which
ensued was one of the deepest interest, not merely to the
combatants themselves, but to all the other princes, since
its issue would determine not only the fate of Cyprus
and Syria, but would at once render the victor the most
powerful man in all the world.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="i16"></a> Ptolemy advanced with a fleet of one hundred
and fifty sail, and ordered Menelaus, when the battle
was at its hottest, to sally out from Salamis with his
sixty ships and throw the fleet of Demetrius into disorder
by attacking it in the rear. Demetrius sent ten ships
to oppose these sixty, for the mouth of the harbour (of
Salamis) was so narrow that this number sufficed to close
it. He himself now got his land force under arms,
disposed it upon several neighbouring promontories, and
put to sea with one hundred and eighty ships. He bore
straight down upon the enemy’s fleet, and completely
defeated it. Ptolemy himself, when all was lost, escaped
with only eight ships, the sole survivors of his fleet.
All the rest were sunk, except seventy which were
captured with their crews on board. All his numerous
train of servants, friends and wives, all his arms, money
and military engines, which were stationed near the fleet
in transports, were captured by Demetrius, who at once
conveyed them to his own camp.</p>
<p>Among the spoil was the celebrated Lamia, who had
at first been brought into notice by her musical skill,
for she was an admirable flute-player, and who had
afterwards become notorious by her amours. Her beauty
was at this time somewhat faded, yet, although Demetrius
was much younger than herself, she so fascinated and
enslaved him by her charms, that, though many other
women wished for his love, he cared only for her.</p>
<p>After the sea-fight, Menelaus held out no longer, but
surrendered Salamis to Demetrius, with all his ships, and
a land army of twelve hundred cavalry and twelve
thousand heavy-armed infantry.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="i17"></a> Demetrius added to the glory of this brilliant
victory by his generous and humane conduct in burying
the enemy’s dead with great honour, and in setting <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>free
all his prisoners. He sent a present to the Athenians
of twelve hundred complete suits of armour from the
spoils which he had taken. He also sent Aristodemus
of Miletus to bear the news of the victory to his father.
Of all his courtiers, this man was the boldest flatterer,
and on this occasion he surpassed himself. After his
passage from Cyprus, he would not allow his ship to
approach the land, but cast anchor, bade all the crew
remain on board, and himself rowed ashore in a small
boat. He now walked up to the palace of Antigonus,
who was in a state of great excitement and impatience
to learn the issue of the battle, as may easily be imagined,
considering the importance of the stake. When he heard
that Aristodemus was come, his anxiety reached its
highest pitch. He could scarcely keep himself indoors,
and sent messenger after messenger, both servants and
his own friends, to learn from Aristodemus what had
taken place. Aristodemus returned no answer to any of
them, but walked leisurely on with immovable countenance.
Antigonus could bear the suspense no longer,
but came to the door of his palace to meet Aristodemus,
who was now accompanied by a large crowd. When he
came near, he stretched forth his right hand, and in a
loud voice exclaimed, “Hail, King Antigonus. We have
defeated Ptolemy in a sea-fight. We are masters of
Cyprus, and have taken sixteen thousand eight hundred
prisoners.” To this Antigonus answered, “Hail to you,
also; but you shall pay the penalty of having tortured
us so long: you shall wait long before you receive the
reward for your good news.”</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="i18"></a> After this success, the people for the first time
saluted Antigonus and Demetrius with the title of kings.
The friends of Antigonus at once placed a diadem upon
his head, and he sent one to Demetrius, with a letter in
which he addressed him as king. The Egyptians, when
they heard of this, also proclaimed Ptolemy king, that they
might not appear to be dispirited by their defeat. Their
example was soon followed by the other successors of
Alexander, out of rivalry, for Lysimachus and Seleukus
now began to wear the diadem in the presence of Greeks,
though Seleukus had long before adopted the royal style
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in his dealings with Asiatics. Kassander, however,
although every one both in interviews and letters addressed
him as king, never used the title in his own letters, but
signed them simply with his own name as he had been
wont to do.</p>
<p>The assumption of this title produced more important
results than a mere empty change of name and style.
It caused its bearers to be more exalted in their ideas,
more extensive in their ambition, and more pompous and
stately in their demeanour, just as actors when they put
on royal robes adopt also the lofty port and the haughty
voice and carriage of a king. They also became more
severe in their administration of justice, because they
now laid aside that dissimulation by which they had
hitherto concealed their power, and which had rendered
them so much more lenient and gentle in their treatment
of their subjects. So great was the power of the voice
of one flatterer, and such great changes did it effect in
the entire world.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="i19"></a> Antigonus, elated by the successes of Demetrius
at Cyprus, at once marched to attack Ptolemy. He himself
led the land force, while Demetrius accompanied him
along the coast with an enormous fleet. But Medius, a
friend of Antigonus, was warned in a dream of what was
destined to be the issue of the campaign. He dreamed
that Antigonus with all his army was running a race
in the circus. At first he appeared to be running strongly
and fast, but soon his strength seemed to be ebbing away,
and at last when he turned round the extreme point of
the course and began to return, he was so weak and out
of breath that he could hardly recover himself.</p>
<p>Indeed Antigonus by land met with many disasters,
while Demetrius at sea met with a terrible storm, and
narrowly escaped being driven ashore upon an iron-bound
coast. He lost many ships, and returned without having
accomplished anything. Antigonus was now very near
eighty years of age, and was incapacitated for active
service by his size and unwieldiness rather than by his age.
He consequently entrusted the management of the war to
Demetrius, who had already by his good fortune and skill
conducted several most important campaigns with success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>
<p>Antigonus was not alarmed at his amours, his extravagancies,
or his carousals, for he knew that, although in
time of peace Demetrius used to indulge unrestrainedly
in these pleasures, yet that in war he was as sober as
though it were natural to him to be so. It is said that,
in allusion to the empire which Lamia had now gained
over Demetrius, once when he affectionately embraced his
father on his return from a journey, Antigonus said, “My
boy, you seem to think that you are caressing Lamia.”
Another time, when Demetrius spent several days in
drinking, and excused himself by saying that he had been
laid up with a severe cold, Antigonus answered, “So I
understood, but was the cold Chian or Thasian?” Once
Antigonus heard that Demetrius had a fever, and went to
see him. At the door he met one of his favourites coming
out. He went in, sat down by his bedside, and took him
by the hand. When Demetrius said that the fever had
just left him, Antigonus answered, “Yes, I met it just
now at the door.” So gently did he deal with the vices
of Demetrius, because of his many other good qualities.
The Scythians have a custom of twanging their bows
while they are drinking and carousing, as though to
recall their courage while it is melting away in pleasure;
but Demetrius used to give up his whole thoughts at one
time to pleasure, and at another to serious work, concentrating
his entire attention upon the matter in hand, so
that his amusements never interfered with his preparations
for war.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="i20"></a> He appears indeed to have been better able to
make preparations for war than to use them, for he always
liked to be more than sufficiently provided with stores of
every kind, and always wished to construct larger ships,
and more powerful battering engines, in the working of
which he took an especial delight. He was intelligent
and clever, and did not waste his mechanical ingenuity in
mere pastime, like other princes, who have amused themselves
by playing on the flute, painting, or working in
metal. Æropus, king of Macedonia, used to employ his
leisure time in making little tables and lamps; while
Attalus, surnamed Philometor, amused himself by cultivating
poisonous herbs, not merely hyoscyamus and hellebore,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
but even hemlock, aconite and dorycnium.<a id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_298_298">298</a> These
he used to plant and tend with his own hands in the royal
gardens, and made it his business to know their various
juices and fruit, and to gather it in due season. The kings
of Parthia, too, used to pride themselves upon sharpening
the points of their own javelins. But the mechanics of
Demetrius were always upon a royal scale, and his engines
were of enormous size, showing by their admirable and
ingenious construction the grand ideas of their inventor;
for they appeared worthy not only of the genius and
wealth, but of the hand of a king. Their size astonished
his friends, while their beauty charmed even his enemies,
and this praise is far from being as exaggerated as it
sounds; for his enemies actually stood in crowds along
the sea-shore to admire his ships of fifteen and sixteen
banks of oars, while his “city-takers”<a id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_299_299">299</a> were regarded as
wonders even by the towns against which they were employed,
as we may see in a notable example. Lysimachus,
who of all the kings of his time was the bitterest enemy
of Demetrius, when he was endeavouring to force Demetrius
to raise the siege of Soli in Cilicia, sent a message to
him asking to be allowed to see his siege engines and his
ships of war. Demetrius indulged his curiosity, and after
viewing them he retired home. The Rhodians also, after
they had stood a long siege, when they came to terms with
Demetrius, begged for some of his machines, which they
wished to keep both as a memorial of his power and of
their own courage.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="i21"></a> Demetrius went to war with the Rhodians because
they were the allies of Ptolemy, and brought up to their
walls his largest “city-taker,” a machine with a square
base, each side of which measured eight-and-forty cubits
at the bottom. It was sixty-six cubits in height, and its
upper part was much narrower than the base. Within, it
was divided into many separate storeys and chambers,
with windows on each storey opening towards the enemy,
through which missiles of every kind could be shot, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>was full of soldiers armed with every kind of weapon. It
never shook nor trembled, but rolled steadily onwards,
upright and firm, with a regular, equable motion, which
filled all spectators with terror and delight. Two steel
corslets were brought from Cyprus for Demetrius to use
in this war, each of which weighed forty minæ.<a id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_300_300">300</a> The
maker, Zoilus, in order to show their strength and power
of resisting a blow, bade Demetrius shoot a dart out of a
catapult at one of them at a distance of twenty paces.
Where it struck, the iron remained unbroken, and only
showed a trifling scratch, such as might be made by a
stilus, or iron pen for writing on wax. This corslet
Demetrius wore himself. He gave the other to Alkimus
of Epirus, the bravest and most warlike man in all his
army, who wore a suit of armour weighing two talents,<a id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_301_301">301</a>
while that of all the rest weighed only one talent. This
man fell during the siege of Rhodes, in a battle near the
theatre.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="i22"></a> The Rhodians defended themselves with great
spirit, and Demetrius was unable to accomplish anything
against them; but he still continued the siege out of
anger, because they had captured a ship in which his wife
Phila had sent him letters, clothes and bedding, and had
sent it at once to Ptolemy, just as it was. In this they
were far from imitating the courtesy of the Athenians,
who, when Philip was at war with them, captured a messenger
and read all the letters which he carried except one
written by Olympias, which they did not open, but sent
it on to him with the seal unbroken. However, although
Demetrius was much nettled by the conduct of the Rhodians,
he did not stoop to retaliation upon them, although
he soon had an opportunity of doing so. Protogenes of
Kaunus happened at that time to be painting a picture of
Ialysus<a id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_302_302">302</a> for the Rhodians, and Demetrius found the
picture very nearly completed in one of the suburbs of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>the city. The Rhodians sent a herald and begged him to
spare the work, and not destroy it, to which he answered,
that he would rather burn his father’s statues than such
a precious work of art. Apelles tells us that when he saw
this picture, the sight at first took away his breath; and
that at last he said, “Indeed this is a wonderful piece of
work, and must have cost great labour.” Yet it has not
that grace which gives so divine a charm to the works of
Apelles himself. This picture shared the common lot of
all Greek works of art, being taken to Rome, where it was
destroyed by fire. As the Rhodians gallantly held their
own in the war, Demetrius became weary of the siege,
and gladly accepted the offer of the Athenians to act as
mediators. They made peace between them on condition
that the Rhodians should act as the allies of Antigonus
and Demetrius, except against Ptolemy.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="i23"></a> The Athenians now invited Demetrius to come
to their aid, as Kassander was besieging Athens. Demetrius
arrived with three hundred and thirty ships, and a
large land force. He not only drove Kassander out of
Attica, but pursued him as far as Thermopylæ, where he
defeated him in a battle, and gained possession of the
city of Heraklea, which voluntarily surrendered to him.
A body of six thousand Macedonians also deserted from
Kassander and joined him. On his return he freed the
Greeks south of Thermopylæ from Macedonian domination,
formed an alliance with the Boeotians and took
Kenchreæ. He destroyed the forts at Phyle and Panaktum
in Attica, which had been garrisoned by Kassander’s
troops, and restored them to the Athenians. They, although
they appeared to have exhausted every possible
form of adulation during his former visit, yet contrived to
flatter him by the invention of fresh honours. They
assigned the interior of the Parthenon to him for his
lodging; and there he dwelt with the title of “the guest
of Athena,” though he was a very ill-behaved guest
to be quartered in the house of a virgin goddess. Yet
once, when his father heard that his brother Philip
was staying in a house where there were three young
women, he said nothing to Philip, but in his presence
sent for the quartermaster and said to him, “Will <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>you
be so good as to find some less crowded quarters for
my son.”</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="i24"></a> Demetrius, however, without paying the least
respect to Athena, although he was wont to call her his
elder sister, filled the Acropolis with such a series of
outrages on well-born youths and women of the upper
classes that the place became comparatively decent when
he contented himself with holding an orgie in the society
of the celebrated courtesans, Chrysis, Lamia, Demo and
Antikyra. For the sake of the city I will say no more
about his other debaucheries, but I cannot refrain from
mentioning the virtue and chastity shown by Demokles.
He was very young, and his beauty did not escape the
notice of Demetrius; indeed his nickname betrayed him,
for he was always spoken of as Demokles the Handsome.
He turned a deaf ear to all advances, presents, or threats,
and at last ceased to frequent the gymnasium and the
palæstra, and used only a private bath. Demetrius
watched his opportunity, and surprised him there alone.
The boy, when he saw that he was caught where no one
could help him, rather than suffer violence, took off the
lid of the copper, leaped into the boiling water, and
destroyed himself. He deserved a better fate, but the
spirit which prompted the act was worthy of his country
and of his beauty, and was very different to that of
Kleaenetus the son of Kleomedon, who, when his father
was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, obtained a
remission of it from Demetrius, and showed a letter from
Demetrius to the Athenian people signifying his pleasure
in the matter; by which conduct Kleaenetus not only
disgraced himself, but threw the whole city into a ferment.
Kleomedon’s fine was remitted, but the people
decreed that no citizen should ever again bring them a
letter from Demetrius. However, as Demetrius was
greatly incensed at this, and did not conceal his displeasure,
the Athenians in terror not only reversed
the decree, but put to death some of those who had
advocated it, and banished others. Moreover, they
actually decreed that “the entire people of Athens should
regard anything which King Demetrius might be pleased
to command as both righteous in respect of the gods, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>and
legal as regards men.” When one of the better class of
citizens observed that Stratokles must be mad to propose
such a decree, Demochares<a id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_303_303">303</a> of Leukonoe answered “He
would be mad not to be mad,”<a id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_304_304">304</a> for Stratokles made a
great fortune by his flattery of Demetrius. This speech
was reported to Stratokles, and Demochares was forced to
go into exile. Such was the conduct of the Athenians
when they were relieved of their Macedonian garrison
and were thought to have become a free people.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="i25"></a> Demetrius now proceeded to Peloponnesus,
where he met with no resistance, as the enemy fled before
him, and surrendered their cities to him. He made
himself master of the district known as Akte, and of the
whole of Arcadia, except Mantinea, while he set free
Argos, Sikyon and Corinth, by bribing their garrisons
to evacuate them with a hundred talents. At Argos he
acted as president of the games at the festival of Hera,
which took place whilst he was there. On this occasion
he held a solemn assembly of all the Greeks, and publicly
married Deidameia, a daughter of Æakides, king of the
Molossi, and sister of Pyrrhus. He remarked to the
people of Sikyon that they lived out of their proper city,
and prevailed upon them to remove to the spot which
they now inhabit. He changed the name as well as the
situation of the city, and instead of Sikyon named it
Demetrias.</p>
<p>At a largely attended meeting held at the Isthmus,
Demetrius was proclaimed chief of Greece, as Philip and
Alexander had been in former days; though Demetrius
considered himself to be not a little superior to either of
them, being elated by his good fortune and the immense
force at his disposal. Alexander never deprived a king
of his title, nor did he ever call himself king of kings,
though he raised many to the dignity and style of kings;
but Demetrius scoffed at those who called any one king,
except himself and his father, and was much pleased at
his carousals to hear toasts drunk to the health of Demetrius
the King, Seleukus the Commander of the Elephants,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span></p><p>Ptolemy the Admiral, Lysimachus the Treasurer, and
Agathokles of Sicily the Lord of the Isles. The other
princes laughed at these sallies of Demetrius, and only
Lysimachus was angry that Demetrius should think him
a eunuch; for it was a pretty general custom to appoint
eunuchs to the post of treasurer. Indeed Lysimachus
hated him more bitterly than all of the rest, and, sneering
at his passion for Lamia, used to declare that he had
never before seen a whore act in a tragedy: to which
Demetrius retorted that his whore was a more respectable
woman than Lysimachus’s Penelope.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="i26"></a> Demetrius now set out for Athens, and sent a
letter to the Athenians informing them that he desired
to be initiated, and that he wished to go through the
whole course, including both the lesser and the greater
mysteries. This is not lawful, and never took place
before, as the minor initiation used to take place in the
month Anthesterion, and the greater in Bœdromion.
When the letter was read, no one ventured to offer any
opposition except Pythodorus the torchbearer,<a id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_305_305">305</a> and he
effected nothing; for, at the instance of Stratokles, the
Athenians decreed that the month Munychion should be
called Anthesterion, and in it celebrated the mysteries of
Demeter which are held at Agræ.<a id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_306_306">306</a> After this the name
of the month Munychion was changed again from Anthesterion
to Bœdromion, and Demetrius was admitted to the
second degree, and allowed the privileges of an “epoptes.”
In allusion to this Philippides rails at Stratokles in his
verses as the man</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Who crowds into one month the entire year.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>And, in allusion to the lodging of Demetrius in the Parthenon,
he wrote</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Who treats Acropolis as t’were an inn</div>
<div class="line">And makes the Virgin’s shrine a house of sin.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XXVII.<a id="i27"></a> But of all the outrages and illegal acts of
which Demetrius was guilty at this period, nothing seems
to have enraged the Athenians so much as his ordering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>them speedily to levy a sum of two hundred and fifty
talents, which, when it had been raised by a most harsh
and pitiless series of exactions, was publicly presented by
Demetrius to Lamia and her sisterhood to furnish their
toilet-tables. It was the disgrace of the whole business
and the scorn which it brought upon them, which stung
them to the quick, more than the loss of the money.
Some writers say that it was the people of Thessaly, not
the Athenians, whom he treated in this manner. However,
besides this, Lamia extorted money from many
citizens on pretence of providing a supper for the king.
This supper was so famous on account of the enormous sum
which it cost, that a history of it was written by Lynkeus
of Samos. For this reason one of the comic poets very
cleverly called Lamia a “city-taker.” Demochares of
Soli called Demetrius himself “Mythus,” or “Fable,”
because he too had his Lamia.<a id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_307_307">307</a></p>
<p>Indeed the passion of Demetrius for Lamia caused not
only his wives but his friends to dislike her and be jealous
of her. Some of them went on an embassy to Lysimachus,
and he when at leisure showed them on his thighs and
arms the scars of deep wounds caused by a lion’s claws,
telling them of how King Alexander had fastened him
in the same cage with the beast, and the battle he had
fought with it. On hearing this they laughingly said
that their master also frequently showed upon his neck
the marks of a savage beast called Lamia, which he kept.
The wonder was that Demetrius, who had objected to
Phila as being past her first youth, should yet be so
captivated by Lamia, who was now far advanced in years.
Once when Lamia was playing on the flute at a banquet,
Demetrius asked the courtesan Demo, who was surnamed
Mania, what she thought of her. “I think her an old
woman, my king,” replied she. Again when the sweetmeats
were placed on the table, Demetrius said to Demo,
“Do you see what fine things Lamia sends me?” “My
mother,” answered Demo, “will send you many more if
only you will sleep with her.” A saying of Lamia’s about
the well-known judgment of Bocchoris has been recorded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>
<p>A certain Egyptian became enamoured of the courtesan
Thonis, but she set too high a price upon her favours for
him. Afterwards he dreamed that he had enjoyed her,
and his passion for her cooled. Upon this Thonis sued
him in court for the money, and Bocchoris, having heard
the case argued, ordered the man to place the exact sum
which she demanded in a glass vessel, and to wave it
backwards and forwards while she clutched at the shadow,
because the young man’s dream had been a shadow of the
reality.<a id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_308_308">308</a> Lamia said that she did not think this decision
a just one, because the woman’s desire for the gold was
not satisfied by the shadow, as the young man’s passion
had been by his dream.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="i28"></a> But now the fortunes and deeds of the subject
of our narrative force us to pass from a comic to a tragic
scene, for all the other kings conspired against Antigonus,
and united their forces together. Demetrius hereupon
sailed away from Greece and joined his father, who was
making wonderful exertions for a man of his age, and
who was greatly encouraged by his son’s arrival. Yet
it appears as though Antigonus, if only he would have
made some small concessions and restrained his excessive
love of power, might have enjoyed his supreme dignity
to the end of his life, and might have bequeathed to his
son his position of chief of all the successors of Alexander.
Being, however, by nature haughty and disdainful, and
even harsher in word than in deed, he alienated from
himself and exasperated many young and powerful men;
and even now he boasted that he would scatter the confederacy
by which he was menaced as easily as a man
scares a flock of birds away from a field. He took the
field with more than seventy thousand infantry, ten
thousand cavalry, and seventy-five elephants, while his
enemies’ army numbered sixty-four thousand infantry,
five hundred more cavalry than his own, four hundred
elephants, and one hundred and twenty war-chariots.
When they drew near he became less hopeful rather than
less determined. He was always wont to show a lofty
and boastful spirit in the hour of danger, speaking in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>loud tone, using confident language, and after making
some jest when in the presence of the enemy, to show his
own assurance of success and contempt for his opponents.
Now, however, he was thoughtful and silent, and presented
his son to the army as his successor. But what astonished
every one most of all was that he held council with Demetrius
alone in the tent, although he never before had shared
his secret thoughts even with his son, but had always
privately formed his own plans, and publicly carried them
out on his own responsibility. It is said that Demetrius,
when still very young, once asked him at what hour he
proposed to march, to which Antigonus angrily answered,
“Do you fear, that you alone will not hear the sound of
the trumpet?”</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="i29"></a> On this occasion it appears that they were also
disheartened by sinister omens. Demetrius dreamed that
Alexander appeared before him in shining armour, and
inquired what would be their watchword for the battle.
When Demetrius answered “Zeus and victory,” Alexander
replied, “I will go away now, and tell this to the enemy;
for I am going over to them.” Antigonus, too, as he
stepped out of his tent to see his line formed stumbled and
fell heavily upon his face. When he rose, he lifted his
hands to heaven and prayed to the gods that they would
either grant him victory or a painless death before his
army was routed.</p>
<p>When the battle began, Demetrius with the flower of
the cavalry charged Antiochus the son of Seleukus, and
brilliantly routed the enemy, but he lost the day by his
headstrong eagerness to pursue too far. He was unable
to rejoin the infantry, for the enemy’s elephants interposed
between him and the phalanx, which was thus left without
any cavalry to cover its flanks. Seeing this, Seleukus
kept the rest of his cavalry ever threatening to charge,
but never actually doing so, hovering near the phalanx
and both terrifying it and giving the men an opportunity of
changing sides, which indeed took place; for a great mass
of Antigonus’s infantry came over to Seleukus, and the
rest fled. Many enemies now beset Antigonus, and one of
his attendants said to him, “My king, it is you whom
they are making for.” “Why,” replied he, “what <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>other
mark could they have but me? But Demetrius will
soon be here to the rescue.” While he looked round
hoping in vain to see his son, a shower of darts fell, and
laid him low. All his friends and attendants now fled,
except one named Thorax, a native of Larissa, who
remained by the corpse.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="i30"></a> After this battle the victorious kings proceeded
to divide the empire of Antigonus and Demetrius amongst
them, each annexing the portion which lay nearest to his
own dominions, as though they were cutting slices out of
some huge slaughtered beast. Demetrius fled with five
thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry, and
directed his march with the utmost speed towards
Ephesus. All imagined that in his distress for money he
would not spare the rich temple there, and he himself,
fearing lest his soldiers should do so, set sail as quickly as
possible for Greece, as his chief hopes now lay in Athens.
Indeed he had left there a part of his fleet, some treasure
and his wife Deidameia, and imagined that he could find
no surer refuge in his adversity than Athens, where he
felt assured of the loyalty of the people. But while he
was passing the Cyclades he met an embassy from Athens
begging him not to approach that city, since the people
had decreed that none of the kings should be admitted
within its walls. The ambassadors added that his wife
Deidameia had been escorted with due honour and respect
to Megara. On hearing this, Demetrius, who had borne
the rest of his misfortunes with the utmost serenity, and
had never hitherto allowed an unworthy expression to
escape him, became transported with anger. He was, in
truth, bitterly grieved at being thus unexpectedly betrayed
by the Athenians, and at finding that their apparent
enthusiasm in his cause had all the while been unreal and
fictitious. Apparently the bestowal of excessive honours
upon kings and potentates by the people is but a poor
test of their real loyalty, for the essence of these honours
lies in their being freely offered, and they are worthless
if prompted by fear; and men fawn upon those they fear
just as they do upon those whom they really love. For
this reason sensible men know how to value the erection of
their statues, flattering decrees, and other public honours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
by reflecting upon what they themselves have done for
their admirers; for by this means they can discern
whether these are really genuine expressions of respect, or
are extorted by terror; for peoples frequently confer
these very distinctions upon men whom they hate and
abhor, but whom they are forced to honour against their
will.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="i31"></a> Demetrius, although he considered that he had
been very badly treated by the Athenians, was powerless
to resent their conduct. He sent an embassy to Athens,
gently complaining of their conduct, and requesting that
they would restore his ships, one of which was a vessel of
thirteen banks of oars. Having received them he coasted
along as far as the Isthmus, where he found that all his
garrisons had been driven out of the cities, and that the
whole country had gone over to his enemies. He now
left Pyrrhus to act as his lieutenant in Greece, and himself
sailed to the Chersonese.<a id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_309_309">309</a> Here he enriched his troops at
the expense of Lysimachus by plundering the country,
and soon found means again to collect a very considerable
army. The other kings paid no regard to Lysimachus,
thinking that he was no better a man than Demetrius,
and more to be feared because he was more powerful.</p>
<p>Not long after this Seleukus sent an embassy to Demetrius
to make proposals for the hand of Stratonike, the
daughter of Demetrius by his wife Phila. Seleukus
already had one son named Antiochus by his wife Apama,
a Persian lady, but he thought that his empire would
suffice for more than one heir, and he desired to form an
alliance with Demetrius, because Lysimachus had recently
married one of Ptolemy’s daughters himself, and taken
the other for his son Agathokles. To Demetrius this
offer of marriage from Seleukus was a most unexpected
piece of good fortune. He placed his daughter on board
ship, and sailed with his entire fleet to Syria. On his
way he was forced to land several times to obtain supplies,
especially on the coast of Cilicia, which province, after
the battle in which Antigonus fell, had been bestowed
upon Pleistarchus, the brother of Kassander. Pleistarchus
took umbrage at the intrusion of Demetrius into his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>territory, and retired to Macedonia to complain to his
brother that Seleukus was betraying the other kings by
making terms with the common enemy of them all.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="i32"></a> Demetrius, when he discovered the intentions
of Pleistarchus, proceeded at once to Quinda, where he
found the sum of twelve hundred talents still remaining.
Having made himself master of this, he quickly reembarked
and put to sea. He was now joined by his wife
Phila, and met Seleukus at Rhossas. Here the two princes
conversed together in a truly royal style, without the
least suspicion or fear of treachery. First Seleukus feasted
Demetrius in his tent in the midst of his camp, and afterwards
Demetrius entertained him at a banquet on board
his great thirteen-banked ship. They also talked freely
together for a long time, spending several days in
friendly intercourse without any body-guard or arms, till
at length Seleukus took Stratonike, and escorted her with
great pomp to Antiocheia.<a id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_310_310">310</a> Demetrius now made himself
master of Cilicia, and sent his wife Phila to her brother,
Kassander, to answer the accusations brought against him
by Pleistarchus. During this time Deidameia sailed from
Greece and joined Demetrius, but not long after her
arrival she sickened and died. By the good offices of
Seleukus, Demetrius was now reconciled with Ptolemy,
and arranged to take Ptolemäis, Ptolemy’s daughter, for
his wife. So far Seleukus behaved very well; but he
could not prevail upon Demetrius to give up Cilicia to
him for a sum of money, and when he angrily demanded
the surrender of Tyre and Sidon, his conduct appears very
overbearing and ungenerous, as though he, who had made
himself master of all the country between the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean, were so poor and needy as to be
obliged to squabble with his father-in-law about two
cities, at a time, too, when the latter was suffering from a
great reverse of fortune. How strongly does this bear out
the truth of Plato’s maxim, that he who wishes to be
really rich ought to lessen his desires rather than increase
his property, because if a man places no bounds to his
covetousness, he never will be free from want and
misery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="i33"></a> Demetrius on this occasion showed no want
of spirit. He declared that not if he had lost ten thousand
fields like Ipsus would he consent to buy Seleukus for his
son-in-law. He strengthened the garrisons of the cities,<a id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_311_311">311</a>
and hearing that Lachares, taking advantage of the factions
into which the Athenians were divided, had made himself
despot of that city, he thought that if he only were to show
himself before Athens he might easily obtain possession of
it. He crossed the sea in safety with a large fleet, but
when off the coast of Attica he encountered a violent storm,
in which he lost most of his ships and a great number of
his men. He himself escaped unhurt, and at once began
to make war against the Athenians. As, however, he could
not effect anything, he sent his lieutenants to collect another
fleet, and meanwhile proceeded to Peloponnesus.
Here he laid siege to Messene, and during an assault nearly
lost his life, for he was struck full in the face by a dart
from a catapult, which pierced through his jaw into his
mouth. He recovered from his wound, received the submission
of several insurgent cities, and returned to Attica,
where he made himself master of Eleusis and Rhamnus,
and ravaged the country. He captured a ship loaded with
wheat bound for Athens, and hanged the captain and pilot,
which measure terrified the other merchants so much that
they avoided Athens, and a terrible famine took place there,
and the want of food brought about a scarcity of everything
else. A medimnus<a id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_312_312">312</a> of salt was sold for forty drachmas,
and a modius<a id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_313_313">313</a> of corn sold for three hundred drachmas.</p>
<p>The Athenians gained a short respite from their sufferings
by the appearance near Ægina of a fleet of a hundred and
fifty sail, which was sent by Ptolemy to aid them. Soon,
however, Demetrius collected from Peloponnesus and Cyprus
a fleet of three hundred ships, before which those of Ptolemy
were forced to retire. Upon this the despot Lachares
made his escape and abandoned the city to its fate.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="i34"></a> The Athenians, although they had decreed
that anyone who proposed to make peace and come to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>terms with Demetrius should be put to death, now at once
opened their nearest gates and sent an embassy to him;
not that they expected to be well treated by him, but
acting under the pressure of starvation. It was said that,
among other painful incidents, it happened that a father
and a son were sitting in the same room, without any
hopes of surviving, when a dead mouse fell from the roof,
upon which they both started up and began to fight for
it. We are told that during this time the philosopher
Epikurus kept his disciples alive by counting out to them
a fixed allowance of beans every day. This was the condition
of the city when Demetrius made his entry into it.
He ordered all the Athenians to assemble in the theatre,
occupied the stage with armed men, placing his own body-guard
round the part usually reserved for the actors, and
made his appearance, like a tragic actor, through the
entrance at the back.<a id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_314_314">314</a> The Athenians were greatly
terrified at these proceedings, but the first words of his
address put an end to their fears. He spoke in a mild
and conciliatory tone, briefly and gently, complained of
their conduct towards him, and announced his forgiveness
of them. He distributed among them one hundred
thousand medimni of wheat, and appointed the most
popular men in the city to the vacant magistracies.
Dromokleides the orator, seeing that the people could
scarcely find enough means to express their delight, and
that they were eager to outdo the panegyrics which were
being lavished upon Demetrius from the bema, proposed
that the ports of Peiræus and Munychia should be handed
over to King Demetrius. When this was agreed to,
Demetrius himself placed a garrison in the Museum, by
which he intended to curb the people in case they should
grow restive and take off his attention from his other
enterprises.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="i35"></a> Being now master of Athens, Demetrius at
once began to attack Lacedæmon. He met the King of
Sparta, Archidamus, near Mantinea, defeated him, and
invaded Laconia, driving the beaten army before him.
He fought a second battle before the walls of Sparta itself,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>in which he killed two hundred Spartans, and took five
hundred prisoners; and he very nearly took the city
itself, which up to that time had never been taken.
Fortune, however, seems to have introduced greater and
more sudden vicissitudes into the life of Demetrius than
into that of any other prince, for he was constantly rising
from the most abject poverty to the highest pinnacles of
wealth and power, and then being as suddenly cast down
again. He himself is said, when his fortunes were at
their lowest, to have quoted the verse of Æschylus,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Thou raisest up, and thou dost bring me down.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>So at this time, when everything seemed to be succeeding,
and his empire and power constantly increasing, Demetrius
received the news that Lysimachus had taken all the
cities in Asia which had belonged to him, and that Ptolemy
had made himself master of Cyprus with the exception of
Salamis, which he was besieging, in which city was the
mother and the children of Demetrius. Yet, like the
woman spoken of by the poet Archilochus, who deceitfully
offers water in one hand, while she holds a firebrand in
the other, the fortune of Demetrius, after soaring him
away from the conquest of Sparta by these terrifying
pieces of intelligence, at once offered him hopes of accomplishing
a new and mighty enterprise, in the following
manner.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="i36"></a> After the death of Kassander, his eldest son
Philip ascended the throne, but not long afterwards died.
Upon this Kassander’s two younger sons each aspired to
the crown. One of them, Antipater, murdered his mother
Thessalonike, upon which the other<a id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_315_315">315</a> invited Pyrrhus to
come from Epirus, and Demetrius from Peloponnesus, to
support his claims. Pyrrhus was the first to arrive, and
demanded so large a portion of the kingdom of Macedonia
as the price of his assistance, that he soon became an object
of terror to Alexander. When Demetrius, in answer to
the appeal of Alexander, arrived with his army, Alexander
was even more terrified, because of his great renown. He
met Demetrius near Dium, and welcomed him as an
honoured guest, but gave him to understand that he no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>longer stood in need of his services. Upon this each
began to suspect the other, and Demetrius, when he was
proceeding to a banquet to which he had been invited by
the young prince, was warned that his host intended to
assassinate him while they were drinking after dinner.
Demetrius was not in the least disturbed at this intelligence,
but merely delayed going to the banquet for a
short time, while he ordered his officers to keep their men
under arms, and bade his personal followers and pages,
who far out-numbered the retinue of Alexander, to enter
the banqueting hall with him, and to remain there until
he left the table. Alarmed by these precautions, Alexander
did not venture to offer him any violence; and
Demetrius soon left the room, excusing himself on the
ground that his health would not permit him to drink
wine. On the following day Demetrius made preparations
for departure, announcing that he had received news
which made this necessary. He begged Alexander to
pardon him for so sudden a retreat, and promised that
when he was more at leisure he would pay him another
visit. Alexander was delighted at this, thinking that
Demetrius was leaving the country of his own free-will,
and not as an enemy; and he escorted him as far as the
borders of Thessaly. When they reached Larissa, each
again invited the other to a banquet, each intending to
murder the other. This decided the fall of Alexander,
who fell into his own trap, being loth to show any
distrust of Demetrius, lest Demetrius should distrust him.
He accepted Demetrius’s invitation to a banquet, during
which Demetrius suddenly rose. Alexander in alarm also
started to his feet, and followed Demetrius towards the
door. Demetrius as he passed the door said to his body-guard,
“Kill the man who follows me,” and walked on.
Alexander, who followed him, was cut down by the guard,
as were his friends, who rushed to his assistance. One of
these men when dying is said to have remarked that
Demetrius had got the start of them by one day.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="i37"></a> The night was spent in tumult and alarm.
At daybreak the Macedonians, who had feared an attack
from the army of Demetrius, became reassured, as nothing
of the kind took place; and when Demetrius <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>intimated
to them his wish to address them and to explain his
conduct, they received him in a friendly manner. When
he appeared, he had no need to make a long speech, for
the Macedonians, who hated Antipater for having
murdered his mother, and who knew not where to look
for a better sovereign, saluted Demetrius as King of the
Macedonians, and at once conducted him into Macedonia.
The new reign was not displeasing to the remainder of
the Macedonians, who had never forgotten the disgraceful
conduct of Kassander after the death of Alexander. If
any remembrance of the moderation of their old governor
Antipater still remained amongst them, Demetrius reaped
the benefit of it, as his wife Phila was the daughter of
Antipater, and his son,<a id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_316_316">316</a> by her, who was nearly grown
up, and accompanied his father on this campaign, was
now the heir to the throne.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="i38"></a> After this brilliant piece of good fortune,
Demetrius received the news that his mother and children
had been set at liberty by Ptolemy, who had given them
presents and treated them with respect; while he also
heard that his daughter, who had been given in marriage
to Seleukus, was living with his son Antiochus, with the
title of “queen of the native tribes of the interior.” It
appears that Antiochus fell violently in love with Stratonike,
who was quite a young girl, though she had already
borne a child to Seleukus. After making many fruitless
efforts to resist his passion, he reflected upon the wickedness
of indulging a love which he was unable to restrain,
and decided that he would put an end to his life. Under
pretence of illness he refused to take nourishment, neglected
his person, and was quietly sinking. Erasistratus,
his physician, had without much difficulty perceived
that he was in love, but could not guess with whom.
He consequently spent the entire day in the same room
with Antiochus, and whenever any young persons came
to visit him, narrowly watched his countenance and those
parts by which emotion is especially betrayed. He found
that his condition was unaltered except when Stratonike
came to see him, either alone or with her husband,
Seleukus, and that then all the symptoms mentioned by</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>
<p>Sappho were visible in him, such as stammering, fiery
blushes, failure of eyesight, violent perspiration, disturbed
and quickened pulse, and at length, as his passions gained
the mastery over him, pallor and bewilderment. Erasistratus,
after making these observations, reflected that it
was not probable that the king’s son would starve himself
to death in silence for love of any other woman than his
mother-in-law. He judged it to be a perilous enterprise to
explain the real state of the case, but, nevertheless, trusting
to the love of Seleukus for his son, he one day ventured to
tell him that love was really the disorder from which
young Antiochus was suffering, and that it was a hopeless
and incurable passion. “How incurable?” inquired Seleukus.
“Because,” answered Erasistratus, “he is in love
with my wife.” “Well, then,” said Seleukus, “will you
not give her up, Erasistratus, and marry her to my son,
who is your friend, especially as that is the only way out
of this trouble for us?” “No,” said Erasistratus, “I will
not. Why, you yourself, although you are his father,
would not do this, if Antiochus were enamoured of Stratonike.”
To this Seleukus replied, “My friend, I would
that by any means, human or divine, his passion could
be directed to her; for I would willingly even give up
my crown if I could thereby save Antiochus.”</p>
<p>When Seleukus, in a tone of deep feeling and with tears
in his eyes, made this avowal, Erasistratus took him by
the hand, in token of good faith, and declared that his
own services were quite useless, for that Seleukus himself
was best able to heal the disorders which had arisen in
his household. After this Seleukus convoked a general
assembly of his people, and declared to them that he had
determined to nominate Antiochus king, and Stratonike
queen of all the nations of the interior, and that they were
to be married. He believed, he said, that his son, who
had always been accustomed to obey him, would raise no
objection to the marriage; and that if his wife was discontented
with it on the ground of its illegality, he begged
his friends to argue with her and persuade her to regard
everything as legal and honourable which the king decided
upon as expedient. In this manner it is said to have come
to pass that Antiochus was married to Stratonike.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="i39"></a> After obtaining Macedonia, Demetrius made
himself master of Thessaly also. As he possessed the
greater part of Peloponnesus, besides Megara and Athens,
he now marched against Bœotia. At first the Bœotians
came to terms, and formed an alliance with him, but
afterwards, when Kleonymus of Sparta came to Thebes
with an army, and Pisis, the most influential citizen of
Thespiæ, encouraged them to recover their liberty, they
revolted from Demetrius. Upon this, Demetrius brought
up his famous siege train to attack their cities.<a id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_317_317">317</a> Kleonymus
was so terrified that he secretly withdrew, and the
Bœotians were scared into submission. Demetrius, though
he garrisoned all their cities with his own troops, levied
a large sum of money, and left Hieronymus<a id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_318_318">318</a> the historian
as governor of the province, was thought to have dealt
very mildly with the Bœotians, especially because of his
treatment of Pisis; for he not only dismissed him unharmed
when brought before him as a prisoner, but
conversed with him in a friendly manner, and nominated
him polemarch of Thespiæ.</p>
<p>Not long after these events, Lysimachus was taken
prisoner by Dromichætus. Upon this, Demetrius at once
hurriedly marched towards Thrace, hoping to find it
unguarded. The Bœotians seized the opportunity of his
absence to revolt, while news was brought to Demetrius
that Lysimachus had been dismissed by his captors.
Enraged at this, he speedily returned, and finding that
the Bœotians had been defeated in a pitched battle by
his son Antigonus, he a second time laid siege to Thebes.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="i40"></a> However, as Pyrrhus was now overrunning Thessaly,
and had pushed even as far as Thermopylæ, Demetrius
left Antigonus to prosecute the siege, and himself
marched to attack Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus beat a hasty retreat,
and Demetrius, leaving ten thousand infantry and a
thousand cavalry in Thessaly, returned to press the siege
of Thebes. He now brought up his great machine, called
the “City-taker,” which was moved by levers with great
difficulty on account of its enormous weight; so that it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>is said that in two months it hardly moved two furlongs,
The Bœotians made a vigorous defence, and Demetrius
frequently forced his soldiers to engage in battle with
them, more out of arrogance than through any real necessity
for fighting. After one of these battles, Antigonus,
grieved at the number of men who had fallen, said, “My
father, why do we allow all these men to perish, when
there is no occasion for it?” Demetrius sharply answered,
“Why do you take offence at this? Do you have
to pay the dead?” Yet Demetrius, not wishing it to be
thought that he was lavish of other men’s blood and not
of his own, but being anxious to fight among the foremost,
was wounded by a dart thrown from a catapult, which
pierced through his neck. He suffered much from this
wound, but still continued the siege, and at length took
Thebes for the second time. When he entered the city,
he inspired the citizens with the most intense terror, as
they expected to be treated with the greatest severity.
He was satisfied, however, with putting to death thirteen
of the citizens, and banishing a few others. Thus was
Thebes taken twice within less than ten years since it was
first rebuilt.</p>
<p>As the time for the Pythian games had now come
round, Demetrius took upon himself to make a most
startling innovation. As the passes leading to Delphi
were held by the Ætolians, he celebrated the games in
Athens, declaring that it was right that especial honour
should be paid there to Apollo, who is the tutelary god
of the Athenians, and is said to have been the founder of
their race.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="i41"></a> Demetrius now returned to Macedonia. As he
could not bear a life of repose, and found that his subjects
were more easily governed on a campaign, since they
were troublesome and turbulent when at home, he
marched against the Ætolians. After laying waste their
country he left Pantauchus there with a large portion of
his army, and with the rest marched to attack Pyrrhus.
Pyrrhus was equally eager to meet him, but they missed
each other, so that Demetrius invaded and ravaged
Epirus, while Pyrrhus<a id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_319_319">319</a> fell in with Pantauchus and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>fought with him. He himself exchanged blows with
Pantauchus and put him to flight, killing many of his
followers, and taking five thousand prisoners. This did
more damage to the cause of Demetrius than anything
else; for Pyrrhus was not so much disliked for the harm
which he had done them, as he was admired for his
personal prowess. His fame became great in Macedonia
after this battle, and many Macedonians were heard to
say that he alone, of all the princes of the time, revived
the image of Alexander’s daring courage, while the rest,
and especially Demetrius, only imitated his demeanour
by their theatrical pomp and trappings of royalty.
Indeed, Demetrius gave himself the most extravagant
airs, wearing magnificent purple robes and hats with a
double crown, and even wore shoes of purple felt embroidered
with gold. There was a cloak which was for
a long time being embroidered for his use, a most
extravagantly showy piece of work, upon which was
depicted a figure of the world and of the heavenly bodies.
This cloak was left unfinished when Demetrius lost his
crown, and none of his successors on the throne of Macedonia
ever presumed to wear it, although some of them
were very ostentatious princes.</p>
<p>XLII.<a id="i42"></a> The spectacle of this unusual pomp irritated the
Macedonians, who were not accustomed to see their kings
thus attired, while the luxury and extravagance of
Demetrius’s mode of life also gave offence to them. They
were especially enraged at his haughty reserve, and the
difficulty of obtaining access to him; for he either refused
to grant an interview, or else treated those who were
admitted to his presence with harshness and insolence.
He kept an embassy of the Athenians, whom he respected
beyond all other Greeks, waiting for two years for an
audience; and when one ambassador arrived from Lacedæmon,
he construed it as a mark of disrespect, and was
angry. But when Demetrius said to the ambassador:—“What
is this that you tell me? the Lacedæmonians have
sent one ambassador!” “Yes,” answered he cleverly and
laconically, “one ambassador to one king.”</p>
<p>One day when Demetrius came out of his palace he
appeared to be in a more affable humour than usual, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>and
willing to converse with his subjects. Upon this, many
persons ran to present him with written statements of
their grievances. As he received them all and placed
them in the folds of his cloak, the petitioners were greatly
delighted, and accompanied him; but when he came to
the bridge over the Axius, he emptied them all out of his
cloak into the river. This conduct greatly exasperated
the Macedonians, who declared that they were insulted
instead of being governed by him, and who remembered
or were told by older men how gentle and easy of access
Philip was always wont to be.</p>
<p>Once an old woman met him when he was walking, and
begged repeatedly for a hearing. When he replied that
he had no leisure to attend to her, she loudly cried out,
“Then be king no more.” Stung by this taunt he returned
to his palace, and gave audiences to all who wished
it, beginning with the old woman, and so continued for
many days. Indeed nothing becomes a king so much as
to do justice to his subjects. As Timotheus the poet has
it, Ares is a despot, but Pindar tells us that law is lord of
all. Homer also says that kings have been entrusted by
Zeus, not with City-takers or brazen-bound ships, but with
justice, which they must keep and respect; and that Zeus
does not love the most warlike or the most unjust of kings,
but the most righteous, and calls him his friend and disciple.
Demetrius however rejoiced in being called by a
name most unlike that of the Lord of Heaven, for his title
is “The Preserver of Cities,” while Demetrius was known
as “The Besieger.” Thus through the worship of mere
brute force, the bad gradually overcame the good side of
his character, and his fame became sullied by the unworthy
acts with which it was associated.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="i43"></a> While Demetrius lay dangerously ill at Pella,
he very nearly lost his kingdom, as Pyrrhus invaded the
country and briskly overran it as far as Edessa. However,
on his recovery, Demetrius easily drove Pyrrhus out of
Macedonia, and then made terms with him, because he
did not wish to be entangled in a border warfare, which
would interfere with the realisation of his more important
projects. He meditated a colossal enterprise indeed,
nothing less than the recovery of the whole of his father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>’s
empire. His preparations were on a commensurate scale,
for he had collected a force of ninety-eight thousand foot
soldiers and nearly twelve thousand horse, while at
Peiræus, Corinth, Chalkis, and the ports near Pella he
was engaged in the construction of a fleet of five hundred
ships. He himself personally superintended the works,
visiting each dockyard and giving directions to the
artificers; and all men were astounded not only at the
number, but at the size of the vessels which were being
built. Before his time no one had ever seen a ship of
fifteen or sixteen banks of oars, although in later times
Ptolemy Philopator built a ship of forty banks of oars,
which measured two hundred and eighty cubits in length,
and forty-eight cubits in height. This ship was navigated
by four hundred sailors, four thousand rowers, and, besides
all these, had room upon its decks for nearly three thousand
soldiers. But this ship was merely for show, and
differed little from a fixed building, being totally useless,
and only moved with great risk and labour; whereas the
beauty of the ships of Demetrius did not render them less
serviceable, nor was their equipment so elaborate as to
interfere with their use, but they were no less admirable
for speed and strength as for greatness of size.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="i44"></a> When this great armament, the largest ever
collected since the death of Alexander, began to menace
Asia, the three princes, Ptolemy, Seleukus, and Lysimachus,
formed a confederation to oppose it. They next sent a
joint letter to Pyrrhus, in which they urged him to attack
Macedonia, and not to pay any regard to a peace by which
Demetrius had not made any engagement not to go to war
with him, but had merely obtained time to attack the
others first. Pyrrhus agreed to this proposal, and Demetrius,
before his preparations were completed, found himself
involved in a war of considerable magnitude: for
Ptolemy sailed to Greece with a large fleet and caused it
to revolt from Demetrius, while Lysimachus from Thrace
and Pyrrhus from Epirus invaded Macedonia and ravaged
the country. Demetrius left his son to command in
Greece, and himself marched to attack Lysimachus, in
order to free Macedonia from the enemy. He shortly,
however, received the news that Pyrrhus had taken <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>the
city of Berœa, and when the Macedonians heard this,
there was an end to all discipline, for the camp was full
of tears and lamentations, and abuse of Demetrius. The
men no longer cared to remain with him, but became
eager to go away, nominally to their homes, but really to
desert to Lysimachus. Demetrius upon this determined
to place the greatest possible distance between Lysimachus
and himself, and accordingly marched to attack Pyrrhus;
reasoning that Lysimachus was a native of Macedonia,
and was popular with many of the Macedonians because
he had been a companion of Alexander, while he thought
that the Macedonians would not prefer a foreigner like
Pyrrhus to himself. However, in this expectation he was
greatly deceived: for as soon as he encamped near
Pyrrhus, his soldiers had a constant opportunity of admiring
his personal prowess in battle, and they had from the
most ancient times been accustomed to think that the best
warrior is the best king. When besides this they learned
how leniently Pyrrhus had dealt with the captives, as
they had long been determined to transfer their allegiance
from Demetrius to some one else, they now gladly agreed
that it should be to Pyrrhus. At first they deserted to
him secretly and few at a time; but soon the whole camp
became excited and disturbed, and at last some had the
audacity to present themselves before Demetrius, and bid
him seek safety in flight, for the Macedonians were tired
of fighting to maintain his extravagance. Compared with
the harsh language held by many other Macedonians,
this appeared to Demetrius to be very reasonable advice,
and so proceeding to his tent, as though he were really a
play-actor and not a king, he changed his theatrical cloak
for one of a dark colour, and made his way out of the
camp unobserved. Most of his soldiery at once betook
themselves to plundering, and while they were quarrelling
with one another over the spoils of the royal tent,
Pyrrhus appeared, encountered no resistance, and made
himself master of the camp. Pyrrhus and Lysimachus
now divided between them the kingdom of Macedonia,
which had for seven consecutive years been ruled by
Demetrius.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="i45"></a> After this great disaster, Demetrius retired <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>to
Kassandreia. His wife Phila was greatly grieved at his
fall, and could not bear to see Demetrius a miserable fugitive
and exile after having been a king. Despairing of
ever seeing better days, and bitterly reflecting how far her
husband’s good luck was outweighed by his misfortunes,
she ended her life by poison. Now Demetrius, anxious to
save what he could from the wreck of his fortunes, proceeded
to Greece, and there collected his generals and
forces. The verses spoken by Menelaus in Sophokles’s
play—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“But ever whirling on the wheel of fate</div>
<div class="line">My fortune changes, like the changing moon</div>
<div class="line">That never keeps her form two nights the same.</div>
<div class="line">At first she comes with flattering countenance</div>
<div class="line">And fills her orb; but when she is most bright</div>
<div class="line">She wanes again, and loses all her light,”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>seems to express very well the strange waxing and waning
of the fortunes of Demetrius, who, as in the present instance,
sometimes appeared to be quite extinguished, and
then burst forth again as brilliant as ever, as little by little
his power increased until he was able to carry out his plans.
At first he visited the various cities of Greece dressed as
a private man, without any of the insignia of royalty.
One of the Thebans seeing him in this guise, cleverly
applied to him the verses of Euripides:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“A god no more, but dressed in mortal guise,</div>
<div class="line">He comes to where the springs of Dirké rise.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XLVI.<a id="i46"></a> When he again hoped to regain the style of
royalty, and began to gather around him the form and
substance of an empire, he permitted the Thebans to
remain independent. The Athenians, however, revolted
from him. They erased the name of Diphilus, who was
inscribed upon the rolls as “priest of the Saviours,”<a id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_320_320">320</a> and
decreed that archons should be elected after their ancestral
custom; and they also sent to Macedonia to invite Pyrrhus
to come and help them, as they perceived that Demetrius
was becoming more powerful than they had expected.
Demetrius indeed angrily marched upon Athens, and began
to besiege the city, but the philosopher Krates, an able
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and eloquent man, who was sent to make terms with him
by the Athenian people, partly by entreaties, and partly
by pointing out in what quarter his true interests lay,
prevailed upon him to raise the siege. Demetrius now
collected what ships he could, and with eleven thousand
infantry and a few cavalry soldiers sailed to Asia, intending
to detach the provinces of Lydia and Karia from Lysimachus’s
dominions. At Miletus he was met by Eurydike,<a id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_321_321">321</a>
the sister of Phila, who brought him her daughter Ptolemäis,
who had been long before promised to him in the
treaty concluded by the mediation of Seleukus. Demetrius
married her, and immediately after the wedding betook
himself to gaining over the cities of Ionia, some of which
joined him of their own accord, while others were forced
to yield to his arms. He also captured Sardis, and several
of the officers of Lysimachus deserted to him, bringing
him both soldiers and money. When, however, Lysimachus’s
son Agathokles came to attack him with a large
force, he withdrew into Phrygia, meaning if possible to
gain possession of Armenia, stir up Media to revolt, and
make himself master of the provinces in the interior,
among which a fugitive could easily find an abundance
of places of refuge. Agathokles pressed him hard, and
Demetrius, although victorious in all the skirmishes which
took place, was reduced to great straits, as he was cut
off from his supplies of provisions and forage, while his
soldiers began to suspect him of meaning to lead them to
Armenia and Media. Famine now began to distress his
army, and he also lost a large body of men, who were
swept away in crossing the river Lykus through mistaking
the ford. Yet the men did not cease to joke;
and one of them wrote before the tent of Demetrius the
first verses of the play of [Oe]dipus at Kolonus, slightly
altered:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Child of Antigonus, the blind old man,</div>
<div class="line">What place is this, at which we have arrived?”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XLVII.<a id="i47"></a> At last famine, as usually happens, produced a
pestilence, because the men ate whatever they could find;
and Demetrius, after losing no less than eight thousand,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>gave up his project, and led back the remainder. He
proceeded to Tarsus, and would, if possible, have abstained
from living on the neighbouring country which belonged
to Seleukus, and so giving him an excuse for attacking him.
However, this was impossible, as his soldiers were reduced
to the last extremities of want, and Agathokles had fortified
the passes of the Taurus range of mountains. Demetrius
now wrote a letter to Seleukus, containing a long and
piteous account of his misfortunes, and begging Seleukus
as a relative to take pity on one who had suffered enough
to make even his enemies feel compassion for him. Seleukus
seems to have been touched by this appeal. He wrote to
his generals, ordering them to show Demetrius the respect
due to royalty, and to supply his troops with provisions;
but now Patrokles, who was thought to be a man of great
wisdom, and who was a friend of Seleukus, pointed out to
him that the expense of feeding the troops of Demetrius
was not a matter of great importance, but that it was a
grievous error to allow Demetrius himself to remain in his
territory. He reminded him that Demetrius had always
been the most turbulent and enterprising of princes, and
that he was now in a position which would urge the most
moderate and peaceable of men to deeds of reckless daring
and treachery. Struck by this reasoning, Seleukus started
for Cilicia in person, at the head of a large army. Demetrius,
astonished and alarmed at this rapid change in
Seleukus’s attitude, retreated to a strong position at the
foot of the Taurus mountains, and in a second letter
requested Seleukus to allow him to conquer some native
territory occupied by independent tribes, in which he
might repose after his wanderings, or at least to let him
maintain his forces in Cilicia during the winter, and not
to drive him out of the country and expose him to his
enemies in a destitute condition.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="i48"></a> Seleukus viewed all these proposals with suspicion,
and offered to let him pass two months of the winter
in Cataonia, but demanded his chief officers as hostages,
and at the same time began to secure the passes leading
into Syria. Demetrius, who was now shut up like a wild
beast in a trap, was driven to use force, overran the
country, and fought several slight actions <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>successfully
with Seleukus. On one occasion he withstood a charge of
scythed chariots, and routed the enemy, and he also drove
away the garrison of one of the passes, and gained the
command of the road to Syria. He now became elated
by success, and perceiving that his soldiers had recovered
their confidence, he determined to fight Seleukus for his
kingdom. Seleukus himself was now in difficulties. He
had refused Lysimachus’s offer of assistance, through suspicion,
and he feared to engage with Demetrius in battle,
dreading the effects of his despair and the sudden turns
of his fortune. However, at this crisis Demetrius was
seized by a disorder which nearly carried him off, and
utterly ruined his prospects; for some of his soldiers
deserted to the enemy, and some dispersed to their own
homes. After forty days he was able to place himself at
the head of the remaining troops, and with them marched
so as to lead the enemy to suppose that he meant to return
to Cilicia; but as soon as it was dark he started without
any sound of trumpet in the opposite direction, crossed
the pass of Amanus, and began to plunder the plain of
Kyrrhestis.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="i49"></a> Shortly afterwards Seleukus made his appearance,
and pitched his camp hard by. Demetrius now got
his men under arms in the night and started to surprise
Seleukus, whose army expected no attack, and was for the
most part asleep. When he was informed of his danger
by some deserters he leaped up in terror, and began putting
on his boots and shouting to his friends that a savage beast
was coming to attack them. Demetrius, observing from
the noise which filled the enemy’s camp that they had
notice of his attempt, quickly marched back again. He
was attacked at daybreak by Seleukus, and gained some
advantage by a flank attack. But now Seleukus himself
dismounted, took off his helmet, and with only a small
shield in his hand went up to the mercenary troops of
Demetrius, showing himself to them and inviting them to
join him. They knew that he had for a long time refrained
from attacking them out of a wish to spare their lives, and
not for the sake of Demetrius; and they all greeted him,
saluted him as King, and joined his army. Demetrius,
who had seen so many turns of good and ill fortune, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>felt
that this blow was final. He fled towards the pass of
Amanus, and with a few friends and attendants took
refuge in a thick wood for the night, hoping to be able to
gain the road to Kaunus and so to reach the sea, where he
hoped to find his fleet assembled. But when he found
that his party had not enough money to procure them provisions
even for one day, he was forced to adopt other
plans. Soon, however, he was joined by Sosigenes, one of
his friends, who had four hundred gold pieces in his belt,
and with this treasure they hoped to be able to reach the
sea, and started as soon as it grew dark to make their way
over the mountains. But when they saw the enemy’s
watch-fires blazing all along the heights, they despaired
of effecting their passage by that route, and returned to
the place whence they had set out, diminished in numbers,
for some had deserted, and greatly disheartened. When
one of them ventured to hint that Demetrius ought to
surrender himself to Seleukus, Demetrius seized his sword
and would have made away with himself, but his friends
stood round him, and at length talked him over into giving
himself up. He sent a messenger to Seleukus, putting
himself unreservedly in his hands.</p>
<p>L.<a id="i50"></a> Seleukus, when he heard what had happened, said
that it was his own good fortune, not that of Demetrius,
which had saved Demetrius’s life, and had given himself
an opportunity of displaying his clemency and goodness
as well as his other virtues. He at once sent for his servants
and bade them construct a royal tent, and make
every preparation for the reception of Demetrius in a magnificent
fashion. There was one Apollonides at the court
of Seleukus, who had been an intimate friend of Demetrius,
and Seleukus at once sent him to Demetrius, to bid him be
of good cheer, and not fear to meet his friend and relative
Seleukus. When the King’s pleasure became known, a few
at first, but afterwards the greater part of his followers,
eagerly flocked to pay their court to Demetrius, who they
imagined would become the second man in the kingdom.
This ill-judged zeal of theirs turned the compassion of
Seleukus into jealousy, and enabled mischief-makers to
defeat his kindly intentions by warning him that as soon
as Demetrius was seen in his camp all his troops <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>would
rise in mutiny against him. Apollonides had just reached
Demetrius in high spirits, and others were arriving with
wonderful stories about the goodness of Seleukus. Demetrius
himself was just recovering his spirits after his disaster,
was beginning to think that he had been wrong in
his reluctance to surrender himself, and was full of hope
for the future, when Pausanias appeared with about a
thousand horse and foot-soldiers. He suddenly surrounded
Demetrius with these troops, separated him from his
friends, and, instead of bringing him into the presence of
Seleukus, conducted him to the Syrian Chersonese, where,
though strongly guarded, he was supplied by Seleukus
with suitable lodging and entertainment, and allowed to
take the air and hunt in the royal park which adjoined his
dwelling. He was permitted to associate with any of the
companions of his exile whom he wished to see, and many
polite messages were sent to him from Seleukus to the
effect that as soon as Antiochus and Stratonike arrived,
they would come to some amicable arrangement.</p>
<p>LI.<a id="i51"></a> Demetrius now despatched letters to his son, and to
the commanders of his garrisons at Athens and Corinth,
warning them not to pay any attention to any despatches
which they might receive in his name, or even to his royal
signet, but to regard him as practically dead, and to hold
the cities in trust for his heir Antigonus. His son was
much grieved at hearing of his father’s capture, put on
mourning, and sent letters to all the other kings, and to
Seleukus himself, begging for his father’s liberation. He
offered to give up all the places which he still held, and
even proposed to surrender himself as a hostage in place
of his father. Many cities and princes supported his
request, except Lysimachus, who offered to give Seleukus
a large sum of money if he would put Demetrius to death.
But Seleukus, who had always disliked Lysimachus, now
regarded him with abhorrence as a savage villain, and still
continued to keep Demetrius in captivity, under the pretext
that he was waiting for the arrival of his son Antiochus
and Stratonike, that they might have the pleasure of
restoring him to liberty.</p>
<p>LII.<a id="i52"></a> Demetrius at first bore up manfully against his
misfortunes, and learned to endure captivity, taking exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
as well as he could, by hunting in the park, and by
running; but, little by little, he neglected these amusements,
addicted himself to drinking and dicing, and thus
spent most of his time; either in order to escape from the
thoughts of his present condition by intoxication, or else
because he felt that this was the life which he had always
wished to lead, and that he had caused great suffering
both to himself and to others by fighting by sea and land
in order to obtain that comfort which he had now unexpectedly
discovered in repose and quiet. What, indeed, is
the object of the wars and dangers which bad kings
endure, in their folly, unless it be this? although they
not only strive after luxury and pleasure, instead of virtue
and honour, but do not even understand in what real
luxury and enjoyment consist. Be that as it may, Demetrius,
after living in confinement in the Chersonese for
three years, died of laziness, surfeit and over-indulgence
in wine, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.<a id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_322_322">322</a> Seleukus
was greatly blamed for the suspicions which he had entertained
about Demetrius, and greatly repented that he had
not imitated the wild Thracian Dromichætes, who dealt
so kindly and royally with Lysimachus when he had taken
him prisoner.</p>
<p>LIII.<a id="i53"></a> Even the funeral of Demetrius had an air of
tragedy and theatrical display. His son Antigonus, as
soon as he heard that the ashes of his father were being
brought to him, collected all his fleet and met the vessels
of Seleukus near the Cyclades. Here he received the relics
in a golden urn on board of his own flagship, the largest
of his fleet. At every port at which they touched the
citizens laid garlands upon the urn, and sent deputies in
mourning to attend the funeral. When the fleet arrived
at Corinth, the urn was beheld in a conspicuous place upon
the stern of the ship, adorned with a royal robe and diadem,
and surrounded by-armed soldiers of the king’s body-guard.
Near it was seated the celebrated flute-player
Xenophantus, playing a sacred hymn; and the measured
dip of the oars, keeping time to the music, sounded like
the refrain of a dirge. The crowds who thronged the sea-shore
were especially touched by the sight of Antigonus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>himself, towed down with grief and with his eyes full of
tears. After due honours had been paid to the relics at
Corinth, he finally deposited them, in the city of Demetrias,
which was named after his father, and which had been
formed by amalgamating the small villages in the neighbourhood
of Iolkos. Demetrius, by his wife Phila, left
one son, Antigonus, and one daughter, Stratonike. He also
had two sons named Demetrius, one, known as Leptus, by
an Illyrian woman, and the other, who became ruler of
Cyrene, by Ptolemais. By Deidameia he had a son named
Alexander, who spent his life in Egypt. It is said, too,
that he had a son named Korrhagus by Eurydike. His
family retained the throne of Macedonia for many generations,
until it ended in Perseus, during whose reign the
Romans conquered that country. So now that we have
brought the career of the Macedonian hero to a close, it is
time for us to bring the Roman upon the stage.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF ANTONIUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="j1"></a> The grandfather of Antonius was the orator Antonius,<a id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_323_323">323</a>
who belonged to the party of Sulla and was put to death
by Marius. His father was Antonius, surnamed Creticus,<a id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_324_324">324</a>
not a man of any great note or distinction in political
affairs, but of good judgment and integrity, and also liberal
in his donations, as one may know from a single instance.
He had no large property and for this reason he was
prevented by his wife from indulging his generous disposition.
On one occasion when an intimate friend came
to him who was in want of money, and Antonius had none,
he ordered a young slave to put some water into a silver
vessel and to bring it; and when it was brought, he
moistened his chin as if he were going to shave himself.
The slave being sent away on some other business, Antonius
gave the cup to his friend and bade him make use of it;
but as a strict inquiry was made among the slaves, and
Antonius saw that his wife was vexed and intended to
torture them one by one, he acknowledged what he had
done and begged her pardon.</p>
<p>II.<a id="j2"></a> His wife was Julia of the family of the Cæsars, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>woman who could compare with the noblest and most
virtuous of that day. She brought up her son Antonius,
having married after his father’s death Cornelius Lentulus,<a id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_325_325">325</a>
who was one of the conspirators with Catilina and was put
to death by Cicero. This appears to be the reason and the
foundation of the violent enmity between Antonius and
Cicero. Now Antonius says that even the corpse of
Lentulus was not given up to them until his mother begged
it of the wife of Cicero. But this is manifestly false, for
no one of those who were then punished by Cicero was
deprived of interment. Antonius was of distinguished
appearance in his youth, but his friendship and intimacy
with Curio<a id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_326_326">326</a> fell upon him, as they say, like some pestilence,
for Curio himself was intemperate in his pleasures, and he
hurried Antonius, in order to make him more manageable,
into drinking and the company of women and extravagant
and licentious expenditure. All this brought on him a
heavy debt, and out of all bounds for his age, of two hundred
and fifty talents. Curio became security for all this,
and when his father heard of it he banished Antonius from
the house. Antonius for a short time mixed himself up
with the violence of Clodius, the most daring and scandalous
of the demagogues of the day, which was throwing every
thing into confusion; but becoming soon satiated with that
madness and being afraid of those who were combining
against Clodius, he left Italy for Greece and spent some
time there, exercising his body for military contests and
practising oratory. He adopted what was called the
Asiatic style of oratory, which flourished most at that time,
and bore a great resemblance to his mode of life, which
was boastful and swaggering and full of empty pride and
irregular aspiration after distinction.</p>
<p>III.<a id="j3"></a> When Gabinius,<a id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_327_327">327</a> a man of consular rank, was sailing
for Syria, he endeavoured to persuade Antonius to join the
expedition. Antonius said that he would not go out with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>him as a private individual, but on being appointed
commander of the cavalry, he did go with him. In the
first place he was sent against Aristobulus,<a id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_328_328">328</a> who was stirring
the Jews to revolt, and he was the first man to mount
the largest of the fortifications; and he drove Aristobulus
from all of them. He next joined battle with him and
with the few men that he had put to flight the forces of
Aristobulus, which were much more numerous, and killed
all but a few; and Aristobulus was captured with his son.
After this Ptolemæus<a id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_329_329">329</a> attempted to persuade Gabinius for
ten thousand talents to join him in an invasion of Egypt
and to recover the kingdom for him; but most of the
officers opposed the proposal, and Gabinius himself was
somewhat afraid of the war, though he was hugely taken
with the ten thousand talents; but Antonius, who was
eager after great exploits and wished to gratify the request
of Ptolemæus, persuaded Gabinius and urged him to the
expedition. They feared more than the war the march to
Pelusium, which was through deep sand where there was
no water along the Ecregma<a id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_330_330">330</a> and the Serbonian marsh,
which the Egyptians call the blasts of Typhon<a id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_331_331">331</a>, but which
really appears to be left behind by the Red Sea<a id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_332_332">332</a> and to be
caused by the filtration of the waters at the part where it
is separated by the narrowest part of the isthmus from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>the internal sea. Antonius being sent with the cavalry
not only occupied the straits, but taking Pelusium also,
a large city, and the soldiers in it, he at the same time
made the road safe for the army and gave the general
sure hopes of victory. Even his enemies reaped advantage
from his love of distinction; for when Ptolemæus entered
Pelusium, and through his passion and hatred was moved
to massacre the Egyptians, Antonius stood in the way and
stopped him. And in the battles and the contests which
were great and frequent, he displayed many deeds of daring
and prudent generalship, but most signally in encircling
and surrounding the enemy in the rear, whereby he secured
the victory to those in front, and received the rewards of
courage and fitting honours. Nor did the many fail to
notice his humanity towards Archelaus<a id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_333_333">333</a> after his death; for
Antonius, who had been his intimate and friend, fought
against him during his lifetime of necessity, but when he
found the body of Archelaus, who had fallen, he interred
it with all honours and in kingly fashion. He thus left
among the people of Alexandria the highest reputation,
and was judged by the Roman soldiers to be a most illustrious
man.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="j4"></a> With these advantages he possessed a noble dignity
of person; and his well-grown beard, his broad forehead
and hooked nose<a id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_334_334">334</a> appeared to express the manly character
which is observed in the paintings and sculptures of Hercules.
And there was an old tradition that the Antonii
were Herakleidæ, being sprung from Anton, a son of Hercules.
This tradition Antonius thought that he strengthened
by the character of his person, as it has been observed,
and by his dress. For on all occasions, when he was going
to appear before a number of persons, he had his tunic
girded up to his thigh, and a large sword hung by his
side, and a thick cloak thrown round him. Besides, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>which appeared to others to be offensive, his great boasting
and jesting and display of his cups, and his sitting by the
soldiers when they were eating, and his eating himself as
he stood by the soldiers’ table—it is wonderful how much
affection and attachment for him it bred in the soldiers.
His amorous propensities, too, had in them something that
was not without a charm, but even by these he won the
favour of many, helping them in their love affairs and
submitting to be joked with good humour about his own
amours. His liberality and his habit of gratifying the
soldiers and his friends in nothing with a stinted or
sparing hand, both gave him a brilliant foundation for
power, and, when he had become great, raised his power
still higher, though it was in danger of being subverted
by ten thousand other faults. I will relate one instance
of his profusion. He ordered five-and-twenty ten thousands
to be given to one of his friends; this sum the
Romans express by Decies.<a id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_335_335">335</a> But as his steward wondered
thereat, and to show him how much it was, placed the
money out, he asked as he was passing by, What that
was. The steward replying that this was what he had
ordered to be given, Antonius, who conjectured his
trickery, said, “I thought a Decies was more: this is
a small matter; and therefore add to it as much more.”</p>
<p>V.<a id="j5"></a> Now these things belong to a later period. But
when matters at Rome came to a split, the aristocratical
party joining Pompeius who was present, and the popular
party inviting Cæsar from Gaul, who was in arms, Curio,
the friend of Antonius,<a id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_336_336">336</a> changing sides in favour of Cæsar,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>brought Antonius over; and as he had great influence
among the many by his eloquence, and spent money
lavishly, which was supplied by Cæsar, he got Antonius
appointed tribune, and then one of the priests over the
birds, whom the Romans call Augurs. As soon as Antonius
entered on his office, he was of no small assistance
to those who were directing public affairs on Cæsar’s
behalf. In the first place, when Marcellus the consul
attempted to give to Pompeius the troops that were
already levied, and to empower him to raise others, Antonius
opposed him by proposing an order, that the collected
force should sail to Syria and assist Bibulus, who
was warring with the Parthians, and that the troops which
Pompeius was levying should not pay any regard to him:
and, in the second place, when the Senate would not receive
Cæsar’s letters, nor allow them to be read, Antonius, whose
office gave him power, did read them, and he changed the
disposition of many, who judged from Cæsar’s letters that
he only asked what was just and reasonable. Finally, when
two questions were proposed in the Senate, of which one
was, whether Pompeius should disband his troops, and the
other, whether Cæsar should do it, and there were a few
in favour of Pompeius laying down his arms, and all but
a few were for Cæsar doing so, Antonius arose and put the
question, Whether the Senate was of opinion that Pompeius
and Cæsar at the same time should lay down their
arms and disband their forces. All eagerly accepted this
proposal, and with shouts praising Antonius, they urged
to put the question to the vote. But as the consuls would
not consent, the friends of Cæsar again made other proposals,
which were considered reasonable, which Cato
resisted, and Lentulus, who was consul, ejected Antonius
from the Senate. Antonius went out uttering many imprecations
against them, and assuming the dress of a slave,
and in conjunction with Cassius Quintus<a id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_337_337">337</a> hiring a chariot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
he hurried to Cæsar; and as soon as they were in sight,
they called out that affairs at Rome were no longer in any
order, since even tribunes had no liberty of speech, but
every one was driven away and in danger who spoke on
the side of justice.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="j6"></a> Upon this Cæsar with his army entered Italy.
Accordingly Cicero, in his Philippica, said that Helen<a id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_338_338">338</a> was
the beginning of the Trojan war, and Antonius of the civil
war, wherein he is manifestly stating a falsehood. For
Caius Cæsar was not such a light person, or so easy to be
moved from his sound judgment by passion, if he had not
long ago determined to do this, as to have made war on
his country all of a sudden, because he saw Antonius in a
mean dress and Cassius making their escape to him in a
hired chariot; but this gave a ground and specious reason
for the war to a man who had long been wanting a pretext.
He was led to war against the whole world, as Alexander
before him and Cyrus of old had been, by an insatiable
love of power and a frantic passion to be first and greatest:
and this he could not obtain, if Pompeius was not put down.
He came then and got possession of Rome, and drove Pompeius
out of Italy; and determining to turn first against
the forces of Pompeius in Iberia, and then, when he had
got ready a fleet, to cross over to attack Pompeius, he
entrusted Rome to Lepidus, who was prætor, and the forces
and Italy to Antonius, who was tribune. Antonius forthwith
gained the favour of the soldiers by taking his exercises
with them, and by generally living with them, and
making them presents out of his means; but to everybody
else he was odious. For owing to his carelessness he paid
no attention to those who were wronged, and listened with
ill-temper to those who addressed him, and had a bad
repute about other men’s wives. In fine, Cæsar’s friends
brought odium on Cæsar’s power, which, so far as concerned
Cæsar’s acts, appeared to be anything rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>a tyranny: and of those friends Antonius, who had the
chief power and committed the greatest excesses, had most
of the blame.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="j7"></a> However, upon his return from Iberia, Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_339_339">339</a> overlooked
the charges against him, and employing him in
war because of his energy, his courage, and his military
skill, he was never disappointed in him. Now Cæsar,
after crossing the Ionian Gulf from Brundusium with a few
men, sent his ships back, with orders to Gabinius<a id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_340_340">340</a> and
Antonius to put the troops on board and carry them over
quickly to Macedonia. Gabinius was afraid of the voyage,
which was hazardous in the winter season, and led his
army by land a long way about; but Antonius being
alarmed for Cæsar, who was hemmed in by many enemies,
repulsed Libo,<a id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_341_341">341</a> who was blockading the mouth of the
harbour, by surrounding his gallies with many light boats,
and embarking in his vessels eight thousand legionary
soldiers he set sail. Being discovered by the enemy and
pursued, he escaped all danger from them in consequence
of a strong south wind bringing a great swell and
tempestuous sea upon his gallies; but as he was carried
in his ships towards precipices and cliffs with deep water
under them, he had no hope of safety. But all at once
there blew from the bay a violent south-west wind and
the swell ran from the land to the sea, and Antonius
getting off the land and sailing in gallant style saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>shore full of wrecks. For thither the wind had cast up the
gallies that were in pursuit of him and no small number
of them was destroyed; and Antonius made many prisoners
and much booty, and he took Lissus, and he gave
Cæsar great confidence by coming at a critical time with so
great a force.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="j8"></a> There were many and continuous fights, in all of
which Antonius was distinguished: and twice he met and
turned back the soldiers of Cæsar, who were flying in disorder,
and by compelling them to stand and to fight again
with their pursuers he gained the victory. There was
accordingly more talk of him in the camp than of any one
else after Cæsar. And Cæsar showed what opinion he had
of him; for when he was going to fight the last battle and
that which decided everything at Pharsalus,<a id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_342_342">342</a> he had the
right wing himself, but he gave the command of the left
to Antonius as being the most skilful and bravest officer
that he had. After the battle Cæsar was proclaimed
dictator, and he set out in pursuit of Pompeius, but he
appointed Antonius master of the horse and sent him to
Rome: this is the second office in rank when the dictator is
present; but if he is not, it is the first and almost the only
one. For the tribuneship continues, but they put down
all the other functionaries when a dictator is chosen.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="j9"></a> However Dolabella,<a id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_343_343">343</a> who was then a tribune, a young
man who aimed at change, introduced a measure for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>annulling of debts, and he persuaded Antonius,<a id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_344_344">344</a> who was
a friend of his and always wished to please the many, to
work with him and to take a part in this political measure.
But Asinius and Trebellius gave him the contrary advice,
and it happened that a strong suspicion came on Antonius,
that he was wronged in the matter of his wife by
Dolabella. And as he was much annoyed thereat, he not
only drove his wife from his house, who was his cousin,
for she was the daughter of Caius Antonius who was
consul with Cicero, but he joined Asinius and resisted
Dolabella. Dolabella occupied the Forum with the design
of carrying the law by force, but Antonius, after the
Senate had declared by a vote that it was needful to oppose
Dolabella with arms, came upon him and joining battle
killed some of the men of Dolabella and lost some of his own.
This brought on Antonius the hatred of the many, and he
was not liked by the honest and sober on account of his
habits of life, as Cicero says, but was detested; for people
were disgusted at his drunkenness at unseasonable hours,
and his heavy expenditure, and his intercourse with women,
and his sleeping by day, and walking about with head
confused and loaded with drink, and by night his revellings
and theatres and his presence at the nuptials of mimi and
jesters. It is said indeed that after being present at the
entertainment on the marriage of Hippias the mime, and
drinking all night, when the people summoned him early
in the morning to the Forum, he came there still full of
food and vomited, and one of his friends placed his vest
under to serve him. Sergius the mime was one of those
who had the greatest influence over him, and Cytheris<a id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_345_345">345</a> from
the same school, a woman whom he loved, and whom when
he visited the cities he took round with him in a litter;
and there were as many attendants to follow the litter as
that of his mother. People were also vexed at the sight
of golden cups carried about in his excursions as in processions,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
and fixing of tents in the ways, and the laying
out of costly feasts near groves and rivers, and lions yoked
to chariots, and houses of orderly men and women used as
quarters for prostitutes and lute-players. For it was considered
past all endurance that, while Cæsar was lodging
in the open field out of Italy, clearing up the remnant of
war with great labour and danger, others, through means
of Cæsar’s power, were indulging in luxury and insulting
the citizens.</p>
<p>X.<a id="j10"></a> These things appear also to have increased the disorder
and to have given the soldiers licence to commit
shameful violence and robbery. Wherefore, when Cæsar
returned, he pardoned Dolabella; and being elected consul
for the third time he chose not Antonius, but Lepidus
for his colleague. Antonius bought the house of Pompeius
when it was sold, but he was vexed when he was asked
for the money; and he says himself that this was the
reason why he did not join Cæsar in his Libyan expedition,
having had no reward for his former successes. However
Cæsar is considered to have cured him of the chief
part of his folly and extravagance by not allowing his
excesses to pass unnoticed. For he gave up that course of
life and turned his thoughts to wedlock, taking for his
wife Fulvia, who had been the wife of the demagogue
Clodius, a woman who troubled herself not about domestic
industry or housekeeping, nor one who aspired to rule a
private man, but her wish was to rule a ruler and
command a general: so that Cleopatra was indebted to
Fulvia<a id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_346_346">346</a> for training Antonius to woman-rule, inasmuch as
Cleopatra received him quite tamed and disciplined from
the commencement to obey women. However Antonius
attempted by sportive ways and youthful sallies to make
Fulvia somewhat merrier; as for example, on the occasion
when many went to meet Cæsar after his victory in Iberia,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>
<p>Antonius also went; but as a report suddenly reached
Italy that Cæsar was dead and the enemy were advancing,
he returned to Rome, and taking a slave’s dress he came
to the house by night, and saying that he brought a letter
from Antonius to Fulvia, he was introduced to her wrapped
up in his dress. Fulvia, who was in a state of anxiety,
asked, before she took the letter, whether Antonius was
alive; but without speaking a word he held out the letter
to her, and when she was beginning to open and read it,
he embraced and kissed her. These few out of many
things I have produced by way of instance.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="j11"></a> When Cæsar was returning from Iberia<a id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_347_347">347</a> all the
first people went several days’ journey to meet him; but
Antonius was specially honoured by Cæsar. For in his
passage through Italy he had Antonius in the chariot
with him, and behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavianus
the son of his niece, who was afterwards named Cæsar and
ruled the Romans for a very long time. When Cæsar was
appointed consul for the fifth time, he immediately chose
Antonius for his colleague, and it was his design to abdicate
the consulship and give it to Dolabella; and this
he proposed to the Senate. But as Antonius violently
opposed this, and vented much abuse of Dolabella and
received as much in return, Cæsar, being ashamed of these
unseemly proceedings, went away. Afterwards when he
came to proclaim Dolabella, upon Antonius calling out
that the birds were opposed to it, Cæsar yielded and gave
up Dolabella, who was much annoyed. But it appeared
that Cæsar abominated Dolabella as much as he did
Antonius; for it is said, that when some person was
endeavouring to excite his suspicions against both, Cæsar
said that he was not afraid of those fat and long-haired
fellows, but those pale and thin ones, meaning Brutus and
Cassius, who afterwards conspired against him and slew
him.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="j12"></a> And Antonius without designing it gave them a
most specious pretext. It was the feast of the Lykæa
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>among the Romans, which they call Lupercalia,<a id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_348_348">348</a> and Cæsar
dressed in a triumphal robe and sitting on the Rostra in
the Forum viewed the runners. Now many youths of
noble birth run the race, and many of the magistrates,
anointed with oil, and with strips of hide they strike by
way of sport those whom they meet. Antonius running
among them paid no regard to the ancient usage, but
wrapping a crown of bay round a diadem he ran to the
Rostra, and being raised up by his companions in the race
he placed it on Cæsar’s head, intimating that he ought to
be King. But as Cæsar affected to refuse it and put his head
aside, the people were pleased and clapped their hands;
then Antonius again offered the crown, and Cæsar again
rejected it. This contest went on for some time, only a
few of the friends of Antonius encouraging him in his
pressing the offer, but all the people shouted and clapped
when Cæsar refused; which indeed was surprising, that
while in reality they submitted to be ruled over with
kingly power they eschewed the name of King as if it were
the destruction of their freedom. Accordingly Cæsar rose
from the Rostra much annoyed, and taking the robe from
his neck called out that he offered his throat to any one
who would have it. The crown which was placed on one
of his statues certain tribunes tore off, and the people followed
them with loud expressions of goodwill and clapping
of hands; but Cæsar deprived them of their office.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="j13"></a> This confirmed Brutus and Cassius, and when
they were enumerating the friends whom they could
trust in the undertaking, they deliberated about Antonius.
The rest were for adding Antonius to their number, but
Trebonius opposed it; for he said that at the time when
they went to meet Cæsar on his return from Iberia, and
Antonius was in the same tent with him and journeyed
with him, he tried his disposition in a quiet way and
with caution, and he said that Antonius understood him,
though he did not respond to the proposal, nor yet did he
report it to Cæsar, but faithfully kept the words secret.
Upon this they again deliberated whether they should
kill Antonius after they had killed Cæsar; but Brutus
opposed this, urging that the act which was adventured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>in defence of the laws and of justice must be pure and
free from injustice. But as they were afraid of the
strength of Antonius and the credit that his office gave
him, they appointed some of the conspirators to look after
him in order that when Cæsar entered the Senate house
and the deed was going to be done, they might detain
him on the outside in conversation about some matter and
on the pretence of urgent business.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="j14"></a> This being accomplished according as it was
planned and Cæsar having fallen in the Senate house,
Antonius immediately put on a slave’s attire and hid
himself. But when he learned that the men were not
attacking any one, but were assembled in the Capitol, he
persuaded them to come down after giving them his son
as a hostage; and he entertained Cassius at supper, and
Brutus entertained Lepidus. Antonius having summoned
the Senate spoke about an amnesty and a distribution of
provinces among Brutus and Cassius and their partizans,
and the Senate ratified these proposals, and decreed not to
alter anything that had been done by Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_349_349">349</a> Antonius
went out of the Senate the most distinguished of men,
being considered to have prevented a civil war and to
have managed most prudently and in a most statesmanlike
manner circumstances which involved difficulties and no
ordinary causes of confusion. But from such considerations
as these he was soon disturbed by the opinion that
he derived from the multitude, that he would certainly be
the first man in Rome, if Brutus were put down. Now it
happened that when Cæsar’s corpse was carried forth, as
the custom was, he pronounced an oration over it in the
Forum;<a id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_350_350">350</a> and seeing that the people were powerfully led
and affected, he mingled with the praises of Cæsar commiseration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
and mighty passion over the sad event, and at
the close of his speech, shaking the garments of the dead,
which were blood-stained and hacked with the swords,
and calling those who had done these things villains and
murderers, he inspired so much indignation in the men
that they burnt the body of Cæsar in the Forum, heaping
together the benches and the tables; and snatching burning
faggots from the pile they ran to the houses of the
assassins and assaulted them.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="j15"></a> For this reason Brutus and his party left the city,
and the friends of Cæsar joined Antonius; and Cæsar’s
wife Calpurnia trusting to him had the chief part of the
treasures transferred to Antonius from her house, to the
amount in all of four thousand talents. He received also
the writings of Cæsar, in which there were entries made
of what he had determined and decreed; and Antonius
inserting entries in them, named many to offices just as
he pleased, and many he named senators, and he restored
some who were in exile and released others who were in
prison, as if Cæsar had determined all this. Wherefore
the Romans by way of mockery named all these persons
Charonitæ,<a id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_351_351">351</a> because when they were put to the proof they
had to take refuge in the memoranda of the deceased.
And Antonius managed everything else as if he had full
power, being consul himself, and having his brothers also
in office, Gaius as prætor and Lucius as tribune.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="j16"></a> While affairs were in this state, young Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_352_352">352</a>
arrived at Rome, being the son of the niece of the deceased,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
as it has been told, and left the heir of his substance; and
he was staying in Apollonia at the time of Cæsar’s assassination.
He went forthwith to pay his respects to
Antonius, as being his father’s friend, and reminded him
of the money deposited with him; for he had to pay to
every Roman seventy-five drachmæ, which Cæsar had
given by his will. Antonius, at first despising his youth,
said that he was not in his senses, and that being destitute
of all sound reason and friends he was taking up the succession
of Cæsar, which was a burden too great for him
to bear; but as Cæsar did not yield to these arguments
and demanded the money, Antonius went on saying and
doing many things to insult him. For he opposed him in
seeking a tribuneship, and when he was preparing to set
up a golden chair of his father, as it had been voted by
the Senate, he threatened to carry him off to prison, if he
did not stop his attempts to win the popular favour. But
when the youth, by giving himself up to Cicero and the
rest who hated Antonius, by means of them made the
Senate his friends, and he himself got the favour of the
people and mustered the soldiers from the colonies,<a id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_353_353">353</a> Antonius
being alarmed came to a conference with him in
the Capitol, and they were reconciled. Antonius in his
sleep that night had a strange dream; he thought that his
right hand was struck by lightning; and a few days after
a report reached him that Cæsar was plotting against him.
Cæsar indeed made an explanation, but he did not convince
Antonius; and their enmity was again in full activity,
and both of them roaming about Italy endeavoured to stir
up by large pay the soldiers who were planted in the
colonies, and to anticipate one another in gaining over
those who were still under arms.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="j17"></a> Of those in the city Cicero had the greatest
influence; and by inciting everybody against Antonius
he finally persuaded the Senate to vote Antonius to be an
enemy, and to send Cæsar lictors and the insignia of a
prætor, and to despatch Pansa and Hirtius<a id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_354_354">354</a> to drive Antonius
out of Italy. They were consuls for that year;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>and engaging with Antonius near the city of Mutina, on
which occasion Cæsar was present and fought with them,
they defeated the enemy, but fell themselves. Many
great difficulties befell Antonius in his flight; but the
greatest was famine. But it was the nature of Antonius
to show his best qualities in difficulties, and in his misfortune
he was as like as may be to a good man; for it is
common to those who are hard pressed by straits to perceive
what virtue is, but all have not strength enough in
reverses to imitate what they admire and to avoid what
they do not approve; but some rather give way to their
habits through weakness and let their judgment be destroyed.
Now Antonius in these circumstances was a
powerful pattern to the soldiers, for though he was fresh
from the enjoyment of so much luxury and expense, he
drank foul water without complaining, and ate wild fruits
and roots. Bark too was eaten, as it was said, and in their
passage over the Alps they fed on animals that had never
been eaten before.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="j18"></a> His design was to fall in with the troops there
which Lepidus<a id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_355_355">355</a> commanded, who was considered to be a
friend of Antonius and to have derived through him much
advantage from the friendship of Cæsar. Having arrived
there and encamped near, he found no friendly signs, on
which he resolved to try a bold stroke. Antonius had
neglected his hair and he had allowed his beard to grow
long immediately after his defeat; and putting on a dark
garment he approached the lines of Lepidus and began to
speak. As many of the soldiers were moved at the sight
and affected by his words, Lepidus in alarm ordered the
trumpets to sound all at once and so to prevent Antonius
from being heard. But the soldiers pitied the more, and
held communication with him by means of Lælius and
Clodius, whom they secretly sent to him in the dress of
women who followed the camp, and the messengers urged</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>
<p>Antonius boldly to attack the lines, for there were many,
they said, would undertake even to kill Lepidus, if he
wished. Antonius would not consent to their touching
Lepidus, but on the next day he began to cross the river
with his army. Antonius entered the river first and advanced
to the opposite bank, for he saw already many of
the soldiers of Lepidus stretching out their hands to him
and tearing down the ramparts. When he had entered
and made himself master of all, he approached Lepidus
with the greatest kindness, for he embraced him and
called him father; and in fact he was master of all, but
he continued to preserve to Lepidus the name and honour
of an Imperator. This caused also Plancus Munatius to
join him, for Plancus was at no great distance with a
large force. Being thus raised anew to great power he
crossed the Alps into Italy at the head of seventeen
legions of infantry and ten thousand cavalry; besides
this he left to guard Gaul six legions with Varius, one
of his intimates and boon companions, whom they called
Cotylon.<a id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_356_356">356</a></p>
<p>XIX.<a id="j19"></a> Now Cæsar no longer cared for Cicero when he
saw that he clung to liberty, but he invited Antonius
through the mediation of his friends to come to terms.
The three met together in a small island<a id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_357_357">357</a> in the middle of
a river and sat together for three days. All the rest was
easily agreed on, and they distributed the empire<a id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_358_358">358</a> among
them as if it were a paternal inheritance, but the discussion
about the men who were destined to perish caused
them most trouble, each claiming to get rid of his enemies
and to save his relations. But at length surrendering to
their passion against those whom they hated both the
honour due to their kinsmen and their goodwill to their
friends, Cæsar surrendered Cicero to Antonius, and Antonius
surrendered to him Lucius Cæsar, who was his
uncle on the mother’s side; Lepidus also was allowed to
put to death his brother Paulus; but others say that</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span></p><p>Lepidus gave up his brother to Cæsar and Antonius, who
required his death. I think nothing could be more cruel
or savage than this exchange; for by exchanging murder
for murder they equally destroyed those whom they surrendered
and those whom they put to death, but they
acted more unjustly to their friends, whom they caused to
die even without bearing them any hatred.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="j20"></a> After this settlement, the soldiers, who were
around them, required that Cæsar should strengthen
their friendship by marriage, and should take to wife
Clodia,<a id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_359_359">359</a> the daughter of Fulvia, the wife of Antonius.
This also being agreed to, three hundred persons were
by proscription put to death by them.<a id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_360_360">360</a> When Cicero was
murdered, Antonius ordered the head to be cut off and the
right hand, with which Cicero wrote the speeches against
him. When they were brought, Antonius looked on them
with delight and broke out a laughing several times
through joy; then being satiated with the sight he
ordered them to be placed above the Rostra in the Forum,
as if he were insulting the dead, and not showing his
own arrogance in his good fortune and abusing his power.
His uncle Cæsar being sought and pursued fled for refuge
to his sister, who, when the assassins were standing by
and trying to force their way into her chamber, fixing
herself at the door and spreading out her arms, called out
repeatedly, “You shall not kill Cæsar Lucius, unless you
kill me first, me the mother of the Imperator.” By such
her conduct she rescued and saved her brother.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="j21"></a> The dominion of the three was in most respects
hateful to the Romans; but Antonius had most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>blame, as he was older than Cæsar, and had more influence
than Lepidus, and threw himself without restraint into
his former luxurious and intemperate habits as soon as
he had shaken off all trouble about affairs. There
was added to his general bad repute the hatred against
him on account of the house that he inhabited, which had
been the house of Pompeius Magnus, a man no less admired
for his temperance and his orderly and citizenlike mode
of life than for his three triumphs. For they were vexed
to see his house generally closed to commanders, magistrates
and ambassadors, who were insolently thrust from
the doors, while it was filled with mimi and jugglers and
drunken flatterers, upon whom was expended most of the
money which was got by the most violent and harsh
means. For the three not only sold the substance of
those who were murdered, bringing false charges against
their kinsmen and wives, and tried all kinds of imposts;
but hearing that there were deposits<a id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_361_361">361</a> with the Vestal
Virgins made both by strangers and citizens, they went
and seized them. Now as nothing was enough for
Antonius, Cæsar claimed to share the money with him;
and they also distributed the army between them, and
both went together into Macedonia to oppose Brutus
and Cassius; and they intrusted Rome to Lepidus.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="j22"></a> Crossing over the sea they commenced the
campaign and encamped by the enemy, Antonius being
opposed to Cassius, and Cæsar to Brutus,<a id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_362_362">362</a> wherein no great
deed was performed on the part of Cæsar, but it was
Antonius who gained all the victory and had all the success.
In the first battle, Cæsar, being completely routed by
Brutus, lost his camp and narrowly escaped from his
pursuers; but, as he says in his Memoirs, he retired before
the battle in consequence of one of his friends having had
a dream. But Antonius defeated Cassius; though some
have written that Antonius was not in the battle, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>came up after the battle to join in the pursuit. Pindarus,
one of the faithful freedmen of Cassius, killed him at his
request and order, for Cassius did not know that Brutus was
victorious. After an interval of a few days they fought a
second battle, in which Brutus being defeated killed
himself, and Antonius carried off the chief credit of the
victory, inasmuch as Cæsar was sick. Standing over the
corpse of Brutus he upbraided it gently for the death of
his brother Caius,<a id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_363_363">363</a> for Brutus had put Caius to death
in Macedonia to revenge Cicero; but declaring that he
blamed Hortensius more than Brutus for the murder of
his brother, Antonius ordered him to be massacred on his
tomb; and he threw over the body of Brutus his own
purple cloak, which was of great value, and commanded
one of his freedmen to look after the interment. He
afterwards found out that this fellow did not burn the
cloak with the corpse and that he had purloined a large
part of the expenditure destined for the interment, whereon
he put him to death.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="j23"></a> After this Cæsar went back to Rome, and it
was supposed that he would not live long on account of
his illness. Antonius crossed over into Greece with a
large army, intending to levy money in all the eastern
provinces; for as they had promised to every soldier five
thousand drachmæ, they required more vigorous measures
for raising money and collecting contributions. Towards
the Greeks his conduct was neither unusual nor oppressive
at first, but his love of amusement led him to listen to
the discourses of the learned and to the sight of games
and religious solemnities; and in his decisions he was
equitable, and was delighted at being called a Philhellen,
but still more in being addressed as Philathenæus; and he
made rich gifts to the city. The people of Megara also
wishing to show him something fine, by way of rivalry
with Athens, and requesting him to see the Senate-house,
he went up and looked at it, and on their asking what he
thought of it: “Small, it is true,” he said, “and yet all in
decay.” He also caused the temple of the Pythian Apollo
to be surveyed, as if he intended to repair it; for he made
this promise to the Senate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="j24"></a><a id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_364_364">364</a> Leaving Lucius Censorinus<a id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_365_365">365</a> over the affairs of
Greece he crossed to Asia; and when he had touched the
wealth there, and kings used to come to his door, and
wives of kings vying with one another in their presents
and their beauty let themselves be corrupted in order to
win his favour, and while Cæsar at Rome was worn out
with civil commotions and war, he enjoying perfect leisure
and tranquillity was carried back by his passions to his
usual habits of life, and Anaxenor<a id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_366_366">366</a> a lute-player and
Xuthus a piper and Metrodorus a dancer, and other such
rout of Asiatic theatrical folks who surpassed in impudence
and shamelessness the pests from Italy, had crept in and
managed his residence—it was past all bearing, for
everything was wasted on these extravagancies. For
all Asia, like that city in Sophocles,<a id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_367_367">367</a> at the same time was
filled with incense burning,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
“With pæans too ’twas filled and heavy groans.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Thus, when he was entering Ephesus, women clothed
like Bacchæ, and men and boys equipped like Satyrs and
Pans led the way; and the city was filled with ivy and
thyrsi and psalteries and pipes and flutes, the people calling
him Dionysus, Giver of Joy and Beneficent. He was
this, it is true, to some; but to the many Omestes<a id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_368_368">368</a> and
Agrionius. For he took their property from well-born
men and gave it to worthless men and flatterers; and
certain persons got the substance of many who were still
alive by asking for it as if they were dead. He gave the
house of a citizen of Magnesia to a cook, who, as it is said,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>had distinguished himself by a single entertainment.
Finally, when he was imposing a second contribution on
the citizens, Hybreas<a id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_369_369">369</a> was bold enough in speaking on
behalf of Asia to use these words, which were indeed such
as the common folks would have in their mouths, but were
not ill adapted to flatter<a id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_370_370">370</a> the vanity of Antonius, “If thou
canst take contributions twice in one year, thou canst also
make for us summer twice and harvest-time twice;” but
he concluded with these practical and bold words, that
Asia had given twenty ten thousands of talents; and “if
thou hast not had them, demand them of those who have
received the money; but if thou hast received and hast
them not, we are undone.” By these words he made a
strong impression on Antonius, for he was ignorant of the
greater part of what was going on; and not so much
because he was indolent, as because in his simplicity he
trusted those about him. For there was in his character
simplicity and slow perception; but when he did perceive
his errors, there was strong repentance, and acknowledgment
to those who had been wronged, and excess both in
the restitution that he made and the punishment that he
inflicted. Yet he was considered to surpass the bounds of
moderation rather in conferring favours than in punishing.
His rudeness in mirth and bantering carried its own
remedy with it; for a man might return him as good as he
gave; and he took as much pleasure in being laughed at
as in laughing at others. And this did him mischief in
most things; for he could not believe that those who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>spoke so freely in jest, could flatter him in earnest, and as
he was easily caught by praise, not knowing that some
persons by mingling freedom of expression, like a sharpish
sauce, with flattery, took away from flattery its nauseating
insipidity, by their boldness and babbling over their cups
striving to make their yielding in matters of business and
their assent appear, not the way of persons who keep
about a man merely to please him, but of those who are
overpowered by superior wisdom.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="j25"></a> Such was the disposition of Antonius, upon which
a crowning evil the love for Cleopatra supervening, and
stirring up and maddening many of the passions that were
still concealed in him and lying quiet, caused to vanish
and utterly destroyed whatever of goodness and of a saving
nature still made resistance in him. And he was captured
in this fashion. When he was preparing for the Parthian
war, he sent her orders to meet him in Cilicia to give an
account of the charges made against her of supplying
Cassius with much money and contributions for the war.
Dellius,<a id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_371_371">371</a> who was sent, observing her person and marking
her cleverness in speaking and her versatility, soon perceived
that Antonius would never even think of doing such
a woman any harm, but that she would have the greatest
influence with him; and he applied himself to paying his
court to her, and he encouraged the Egyptian, in the
words of Homer,<a id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_372_372">372</a> to go to Cilicia bedecked in her best
fashion and not to be afraid of Antonius, who was the most
pleasant and kindest of generals. Being persuaded by
Dellius, and collecting from the proofs of her charms upon
Caius Cæsar and Cnæus the son of Pompeius, she had
hopes that she should more easily win over Antonius.
For they knew her when she was yet a girl and inexperienced
in affairs, but she was going to visit Antonius at
an age in which women have the most brilliant beauty and
their understanding has attained its perfection. Accordingly
she got together many presents and money and
ornaments, such as one might suppose that she could bring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>from the greatness of her estate and the wealth of her
kingdom, but she went to Cilicia relying chiefly on herself
and the seductions and charms of her own person.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="j26"></a> Though Cleopatra<a id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_373_373">373</a> received many letters of summons
both from Antonius<a id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_374_374">374</a> and his friends, she so despised
and mocked the man, that she sailed up the Cydnus in a
vessel with a gilded stern, with purple sails spread, and
rowers working with silver oars to the sound of the flute
in harmony with pipes and lutes. Cleopatra reclined
under an awning spangled with gold, dressed as Venus is
painted, and youths representing the Cupids in pictures
stood on each side fanning her. In like manner the handsomest
of her female slaves in the dress of Nereids and
Graces, were stationed some at the rudders and others at
the ropes. And odours of wondrous kind from much incense
filled the banks. Some of the people accompanied her immediately
from the entrance of the river on both sides, and
others went down from the city to see the sight. As the
crowd from the Agora also poured forth, Antonius was
finally left on the tribunal sitting alone. A rumour went
abroad that Venus was coming to revel with Bacchus for
the good of Asia. Now Antonius sent to invite Cleopatra
to supper, but she on her part said that he should rather
come to her. Antonius accordingly, wishing to display
some good nature and kindness, obeyed and came. He
found a preparation greater than he expected, but he was
most surprised at the number of the lights: for it is said
that so many lights were hung down and shewn on all
sides at once and arranged and put together in such inclinations
and positions with respect to one another in the
form of squares and circles, that of the few things that are
beautiful and worthy of being seen this sight was one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="j27"></a> On the following day when Antonius feasted
her in turn he was ambitious to surpass her splendour and
taste, but he was left behind and inferior in both, and in
these very things he was the first to scoff at the coarseness
and rusticity of his own entertainment. Cleopatra,
observing in the jests of Antonius much of the soldier and
the unpolished man, adopted the same manner towards
him freely and boldly. Now her beauty, as they say, was
not in itself altogether incomparable nor such as to strike
those who saw her; but familiarity with her had an irresistible
charm, and her form, combined with her persuasive
speech and with the peculiar character which in a manner
was diffused about her behaviour, produced a certain
piquancy. There was a sweetness also in the sound of
her voice when she spoke; and as she could easily turn
her tongue, like a many-stringed instrument, to any language
that she pleased, she had very seldom need of an
interpreter for her communication with barbarians, but
she answered most by herself, as Ethiopians,<a id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_375_375">375</a> Troglodytes,
Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Medes, Parthians. She is said
also to have learned the language of many other peoples,
though the kings her predecessors had not even taken the
pains to learn the Egyptian language, and some of them
had even given up the Macedonian dialect.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="j28"></a> Now she so captivated Antonius, that though
his wife Fulvia was carrying on war at Rome against
Cæsar on behalf of the interests of Antonius, and a
Parthian army was hovering about Mesopotamia, of which
the king’s generals had named Labienus<a id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_376_376">376</a> Parthian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>governor, and they were about to enter Syria, he allowed
himself to be carried off by her to Alexandria; and there
staying and amusing himself like a young man who had
leisure, he consumed and expended upon pleasure the most
costly of all things, as Antiphon said, Time. They had a
kind of company called Inimitable Livers; and they daily
feasted one another, making an incredible profusion in
their expenditure. Now Philotas of Amphissa,<a id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_377_377">377</a> a physician,
used to relate to my grandfather Lamprias, that he
was then in Alexandria learning his profession, and having
got acquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was
persuaded by him, as was natural in a young man, to view
the costliness and the preparation for the table. Accordingly
he was introduced into the kitchen, where he saw
everything in great abundance, and eight wild boars
roasting, which made him wonder at the number of the
guests. Hereupon the cook laughed and said, the party
at supper was not large, only about twelve; but it was
necessary that everything which was served up should be
in perfection, which a moment of time would spoil. He
said it might happen that Antonius should wish to sup
immediately, and if it so happened, he might defer it by
asking for a cup or by falling into some conversation; and
accordingly, he continued, not one supper is prepared, but
many, for the exact time is difficult to conjecture. This
is what Philotas used to tell; and in the course of time,
as he related, he was among those who attended on the
eldest son of Antonius, whom he had by Fulvia, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
supped with him with the rest of his companions, as a
general rule, when he did not sup with his father. On
one occasion there was a physician present who was bragging
greatly and much annoying the company at supper,
but Philotas stopped him by a sophism of this kind: “If
a man has fever in some degree, we must give him cold
water; but every man who has fever has fever in some
degree; we must therefore give cold water to every man
who has fever.” The man was confounded and put to
silence, whereat the youth being pleased, laughed and
said, “All this, Philotas, I give you,” pointing to a table
full of many large cups. Philotas acknowledged his intended
kindness, though he was far from thinking that a
boy of his age had authority to make such a present; but
after awhile one of the young slaves took hold of the cups
and bringing them in a vessel bade him put a seal on it.
As Philotas made objections and was afraid to take the
things. “Why, you fool,” said the man, “do you hesitate?
Don’t you know that the giver is the son of Antonius, and
that he has permission to give so many things of gold? If
however you take my advice, you will exchange the whole
with us for a sum of money; for perchance the youth’s
father might call for some of the vessels, which are old
and valued for their workmanship.” Such anecdotes as
these my grandfather used to say that Philotas would occasionally
tell.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="j29"></a> But Cleopatra, by distributing flattery not, as
Plato<a id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_378_378">378</a> says, in four ways, but in many ways, and by
always adding some new pleasure and charm to whatever
was either serious or mirthful, completely ruled Antonius,
never leaving him by night nor by day. For she played
at dice with him, and drank with him, and hunted with
him, and was a spectator when he was exercising in arms,
and by night when he was standing at the doors and
windows of the common people and jesting with those
within, she accompanied him in his rambles and freaks,
in the dress of a female slave; for Antonius also used to
dress himself in this style. Accordingly he would return
home always well loaded with coarse abuse and sometimes
with blows. With the greater part he was in no good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>credit; however the Alexandrines took delight in his
extravagances, and joined in his follies without any lack
of cleverness or humour, being pleased therewith and
saying that Antonius put on the tragic mask to the
Romans, but the comic mask to them. Now to relate the
greater part of his follies would be mere trifling. However
on one occasion when he was fishing and was vexed at
his bad sport, Cleopatra also being present, he ordered the
fisherman to dive under the water and secretly to fasten to
the hook some fishes that had been already caught; and he
pulled up two or three times, but not without being detected
by the Egyptian. Pretending to admire, she spoke to her
friends and invited them to come as spectators on the
following day. A number of them got into the fishing
boats, and when Antonius had let down his line, she
ordered one of her own men to anticipate him by diving to
the hook and to fasten to it a Pontic salted fish.<a id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_379_379">379</a> Antonius
thinking that he had caught something pulled up, on
which there was, as was natural, great laughter, whereat
Cleopatra said, “Give up the fishing-rod, Imperator, to us
the kings of Pharos and Canopus; your sport is cities and
kings and continents.”</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="j30"></a><a id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_380_380">380</a> While Antonius was spending his time in such
trifles and extravagances, he was surprised by intelligence
from two different quarters; from Rome, that Lucius his
brother and Fulvia his wife, having first been at variance
with one another and then having warred with Cæsar,
were completely defeated and flying from Italy; the other
intelligence was in no wise more favourable, which was
that Labienus at the head of the Parthians had subdued</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span></p><p>Asia from the Euphrates and Syria as far as Lydia and
Ionia. With difficulty then, like a man roused from sleep
and a drunken debauch, he set out to oppose the Parthians,
and advanced as far as Phœnice, but as Fulvia sent him
letters full of lamentations he turned towards Italy, with
two hundred ships. On this voyage he took up his friends
who had fled from Italy, and learned from them that
Fulvia had been the cause of the war, for she was naturally
a busy and bold woman; but her hope was to draw away
Antonius from Cleopatra, if their should be any disturbance
in Italy. It happened that Fulvia, who was
sailing to meet him, died at Sikyon of some disease, which
rendered a reconciliation with Cæsar more easy. For when
Antonius approached Italy, and Cæsar was evidently not
intending to make any charge against him, and Antonius
was ready to fix on Fulvia the blame of what he was
charged with, their friends would not let them come to
any explanation of these grounds, but brought them both
to terms and distributed the empire, making the Ionian
gulf the boundary, and giving the eastern parts to
Antonius and the western to Cæsar; Lepidus was allowed
to keep Libya; and it was settled that the friends of each
in turns should be consuls, when it did not please themselves
to be.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="j31"></a> This arrangement seemed to be good, but it
required a stronger security, and fortune offered one.
Octavia<a id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_381_381">381</a> was a sister of Cæsar, older than Cæsar, but not by
the same mother; for she was the daughter of Ancharia,
but he was born afterwards of Atia. Cæsar was very
greatly attached to his sister, and it is said she was a most
admirable woman. Octavia was now a widow, for her
husband Caius Marcellus had not long been dead. As
Fulvia was dead, Antonius also was considered to be a
widower; he did not deny that he had Cleopatra, but he
did not admit that he had her as a wife, and he was still
struggling in his judgment on this point against his love
for the Egyptian. Everybody was proposing this marriage
in the hope that Octavia, who in addition to great beauty
possessed dignity of character and good sense, if she were
united to Antonius and were beloved by him, as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>reasonable to suppose that such a woman must be, would
be the conservation and cause of union between them in all
respects. This being arranged between them, they went
up to Rome where the marriage of Octavia was celebrated,
though the law did not allow a woman to marry till ten
months after her husband’s decease, but the Senate in this
case remitted the time by a decree.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="j32"></a> As Sextus<a id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_382_382">382</a> Pompeius was still in possession of
Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and with his numerous
piratical ships, of which Menas the pirate and Menekrates
were commanders, had rendered the sea unsafe to vessels,
and as he seemed to be in a friendly disposition towards
Antonius, for he had received his mother when she had
fled from Rome with Fulvia, it was resolved to come to
terms with him also. They met at the promontory of
Misenum and the mound, the fleet of Pompeius being
anchored close by them, while the forces of Antonius and
Cæsar were arranged by the side of them. Having agreed
that Pompeius should have Sardinia and Sicily on condition
of keeping the sea clear of pirates and sending to Rome a
certain quantity of grain, they invited one another to an
entertainment. They cast lots on the occasion, and it was
the lot of Pompeius to feast them first. Upon Antonius
asking him where they should sup, “There,” said he, pointing
to the commander’s ship of six banks of oars, “for this
is all the paternal residence that is left for Pompeius.”
This he said to reproach Antonius, who had the house that
had belonged to the father of Sextus. Fixing his ship at
anchor and making a kind of bridge from the promontory,
he received them with a hearty welcome. When the
banquet was at its height and jokes against Cleopatra and
Antonius were plentiful, Menas the pirate approaching
Pompeius said to him, so that the rest could not hear, “Will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>you let me cut off the anchors of the ship and make you
master not of Sicily and Sardinia, but of the Roman empire?”
Pompeius, on hearing this, considered with himself
for a short time, and said, “You ought to have done
it, Menas, without mentioning it to me: but now let us be
satisfied with things as they are; perjury is not for me.”
Pompeius, after being feasted by Cæsar and Antonius in
turn, sailed back to Sicily.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="j33"></a> After the settlement of affairs, Antonius sent
forward Ventidius<a id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_383_383">383</a> into Asia to prevent the Parthians from
advancing further, and, in order to please Cæsar, he was
appointed priest of the former Cæsar; and everything else
that concerned public affairs they transacted in common
and in a friendly way. But their games of amusement
caused annoyance to Antonius, as he always carried off
therein less than Cæsar. Now there was with Antonius a
man skilled in divinations, an Egyptian, one of those who
cast nativities, who, whether it was to please Cleopatra,
or whether he said it in good faith, spoke freely to Antonius,
saying that his fortune, though most splendid and
great, was obscured by that of Cæsar, and he advised him
to remove as far as possible from the young man: “For
thy dæmon,” he said, “is afraid of the dæmon of Cæsar,
and though it is proud and erect when it is by itself, it is
humbled by his dæmon when it is near, and becomes
cowed.” And indeed the things which were happening
seemed to confirm the Egyptian; for it is said that when
they were casting lots by way of amusement, in whatever
they might happen to be engaged, and throwing dice,
Antonius came off with disadvantage. They frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>matched cocks,<a id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_384_384">384</a> and fighting quails, and those of Cæsar
were always victorious. Whereat Antonius being annoyed,
though he did not show it, and paying more regard to the
Egyptian, departed from Italy, leaving the management
of his affairs to Cæsar; and he took with him Octavia as
far as Greece, there having been a daughter born to them.
While he was spending the winter in Athens, he received
intelligence of the first successes of Ventidius, who had
defeated the Parthians in a battle, in which Labienus lost
his life and Pharnapates, the most skilful of the generals
of King Hyrodes.<a id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_385_385">385</a> On the occasion of this victory Antonius
feasted the Greeks; and he acted as gymnasiarch for the
Athenians, and leaving at home the insignia of his rank,
he went forth with the rods of a gymnasiarch<a id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_386_386">386</a> and the
dress and white shoes; and he took the youths by the neck
when he separated them.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="j34"></a> As he was going to set out for the war, he
took a crown from the sacred olive,<a id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_387_387">387</a> and in conformity to
a certain oracle, he filled a vessel with water from the
Clepsydra, and carried it with him. In the mean time
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>Pacorus,<a id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_388_388">388</a> the king’s son, with a large Parthian army again
advanced against Syria, but Ventidius engaged with him
in Cyrrhestica and put his army to flight with great loss;
Pacorus himself fell among the first. This exploit, which
was one of the most celebrated, gave the Romans full
satisfaction for the defeat of Crassus, and again confined
the Parthians within Media and Mesopotamia, after being
defeated in three successive battles. Ventidius gave up
all intention of pursuing the Parthians further, because he
feared the jealousy of Antonius, but he visited those who
had revolted and brought them into subjection, and besieged
Antiochus of Commagene<a id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_389_389">389</a> in the city Samosata.
The king proposed to pay a thousand talents and to obey
the order of Antonius, but Ventidius told him to send his
proposal to Antonius; for he had now advanced near, and
he would not allow Ventidius to make peace with Antiochus,
because he wished that this single exploit at least
should bear his name, and that everything should not be
accomplished by Ventidius. As, however, the siege was
protracted, and the citizens, after despairing of coming to
terms, betook themselves to a vigorous defence, Antonius,
who was making no progress, but was ashamed and repented
of his conduct, was glad to make peace with Antiochus
and to take three hundred talents; and after
settling some trifling matters in Syria, he returned to
Athens, and sent Ventidius to enjoy a triumph after bestowing
on him the suitable decorations. Ventidius is
the only Roman to the present time who has had a triumph
over the Parthians; and he was a man of obscure birth,
but the friendship of Antonius gave him the opportunity
of doing great deeds, of which he made the best use, and
so confirmed what was generally said of Antonius and
Cæsar, that they were more successful as generals through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>others than of themselves. For Sossius<a id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_390_390">390</a> also, a legatus of
Antonius, had great success in Syria; and Canidius,<a id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_391_391">391</a> who
was left by Antonius in Armenia, defeated the Armenians
and the kings of the Iberians and Albanians, and advanced
as far as the Caucasus. All this success increased the
name and the fame of the power of Antonius among the
barbarians.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="j35"></a> Antonius being again irritated against Cæsar
by certain calumnies, sailed to Italy with three hundred
vessels; but as the people of Brundusium would not receive
his fleet, he sailed round and anchored at Tarentum.<a id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_392_392">392</a>
There he sent Octavia, for she accompanied him from
Greece, at her request, to her brother: she was then pregnant,
and had already borne him two daughters. She met
Cæsar on the way, and after gaining over his friends
Agrippa and Mæcenas,<a id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_393_393">393</a> she prayed him with much urgency
and much entreaty not to let her become a most wretched
woman after being most happy. For now, she said, all
men turned their eyes upon her, who was the wife of one
Imperator and the sister of another; “but if the worse
should prevail,” she continued, “and there should be war,
it is uncertain which of you must be the victor and which
the vanquished; but I shall be unfortunate both ways.”
Cæsar, being moved by these words, came in a friendly
manner to Tarentum, and those who were present saw a
most noble spectacle, a large army on land tranquil, and
many ships quietly holding on the shore, and the meeting
and friendly salutations of the two Imperators and their
friends. Antonius gave an entertainment first, which
Cæsar consented to for his sister’s sake. It being agreed
that Cæsar should give Antonius two legions for the Parthian war,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and that Antonius should give Cæsar a hundred
brazen-beaked vessels. Octavia, independently of what had
been agreed, asked for her brother twenty light ships<a id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_394_394">394</a>
from her husband, and for her husband a thousand soldiers
from her brother. Accordingly, separating from one
another, the one immediately engaged in the war against
Pompeius,<a id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_395_395">395</a> being desirous to get Sicily; and Antonius, entrusting
to Cæsar Octavia and his children by her and by
Fulvia, crossed over to Asia.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="j36"></a> That great evil, which had long slept, the
passion for Cleopatra, which appeared to be put to rest
and to have been tranquillised by better considerations,
blazed forth again and recovered strength as Antonius
approached Syria. And finally (as Plato<a id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_396_396">396</a> says of the stubborn
and ungovernable beast of the soul), kicking away
everything that was good and wholesome, he sent Fonteius
Capito to bring Cleopatra to Syria. On her arrival he
gave and added to her dominions nothing small or trifling,
but Phœnice, Cœle Syria, Cyprus, a large part of Cilicia,
and further, that part of Judæa which produces the balsam,
and all the part, of Arabia Nabathæa which was turned
towards the external sea.<a id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_397_397">397</a> These donations caused the
Romans the greatest vexation; though he gave tetrarchies
and kingdoms of great nations to many private persons,
and took kingdoms from many, as for instance Antigonus<a id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_398_398">398</a>
the Jew, whom he brought out and beheaded, though no
king before had been punished in this way. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>scandal of the thing was that which gave more offence
than all the honours conferred on Cleopatra. The evil
report was increased by his acknowledging his twin
children by Cleopatra, one of whom he called Alexander
and the other Cleopatra; and he gave to one the surname
of Sun, and the other of Moon. However, he had some
dexterity in putting a good face on bad things, for he
said that the greatness of the Roman power was shown
not in what they received, but in what they gave; and
that noble families were extended by a succession and
progeny of many kings. Thus, for instance, he said, that
his own ancestor was begotten by Hercules, who did not
deposit his successors in a single womb, nor did he fear
laws like Solon’s<a id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_399_399">399</a> and penalties for conception, but gave
nature her course to leave many beginnings and foundations
of families.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="j37"></a> When Phraates<a id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_400_400">400</a> had killed his father Hyrodes
and got possession of the kingdom, other Parthians fled,
not few in number; and among them Monæses, a man of
illustrious rank and great power, fled to Antonius, who
likening the fortune of Monæses to that of Themistocles<a id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_401_401">401</a>
and comparing his own means and magnanimity to those
of the Persian kings, gave him three cities, Larissa and
Arethusa and Hierapolis, which was before called Bambyce.
Upon the Parthian king sending to Monæses a right hand,<a id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_402_402">402</a>
Antonius gladly despatched Monæses to him, having resolved
to deceive Phraates with a pretence of peace, but
claiming the restoration of the standards taken in the
time of Crassus and such of the prisoners as still survived.
Antonius having sent Cleopatra back to Egypt, marched
through Arabia<a id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_403_403">403</a> and Armenia to a place where he reviewed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>his army, which had assembled there, and also the troops
of the confederate kings; and they were many, but the
greatest of all was Artavasdes,<a id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_404_404">404</a> king of Armenia, who
supplied six thousand horse and seven thousand foot
soldiers. There were of the Romans sixty thousand foot
soldiers, and the cavalry which was classed with the
Romans was ten thousand Iberians<a id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_405_405">405</a> and Celts; and of the
other nations there were thirty thousand together with
cavalry and light-armed troops. Yet so great a preparation
and power, which alarmed even the Indians beyond
Bactria and shook all Asia, it is said, was made of no avail
to him by reason of Cleopatra. For through his eagerness
to spend the winter with her, he opened the campaign
before the fit time and conducted everything in a disorderly
way, not having the mastery over his own judgment,
but through the influence of some drugs or magic
always anxiously looking towards her, and thinking more
of his speedy return than of conquering the enemy.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="j38"></a> Now, in the first place, though it was his
business to winter there in Armenia and to give his army
rest, which was worn out by a march of eight thousand
stadia, and before the Parthians moved from their winter-quarters
in the commencement of spring, to occupy Media,
he did not wait for the time, but immediately led forward
his army, leaving Armenia on the left and touching on
Atropatene,<a id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_406_406">406</a> which he ravaged. In the next place, the
engines which were necessary for sieges were carried along
with the army in three hundred waggons, and among
them was a ram eighty feet long; and it was not possible
for any one of them, if it was damaged, to be repaired
when it was wanted, because the upper country only
produced wood of insufficient length and hardness: accordingly
in his hurry he left all the engines behind as
encumbrances to his speed, after appointing a watch and
Statianus as commander over the waggons; and he commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the siege of Phraata,<a id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_407_407">407</a> a large city, in which were
the children and wives of the king of Media. But the
difficulties soon proved what an error he had committed
in leaving behind the engines; and as he wished to come
to close quarters with the enemy, he commenced erecting
a mound against the city, which rose slowly and with
much labour. In the meantime Phraates came down with
a great force, hearing of the waggons being left behind
that carried the machines, and sent many horsemen
against them, by whom Statianus was hemmed in and
killed and ten thousand men with him. The barbarians
took possession of the engines and destroyed them. They
also took many prisoners, among whom was king Polemon.<a id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_408_408">408</a></p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="j39"></a> This misfortune greatly annoyed, as we may
suppose, all the soldiers of Antonius, who at the commencement
of the war had received this unexpected blow;
and the Armenian Artavasdes despairing of the success of
the Romans went off with his troops, though he had been
the chief cause of the war. The Parthians now showed
themselves to the besiegers in gallant array and insultingly
threatened them, on which Antonius, not wishing
to let despondency and dejection abide in his army by
their being quiet and to increase, took ten legions and
three prætorian cohorts of heavy-armed men and all the
cavalry, and led them out to forage in the hope that the
enemy would thus be drawn on, and that a regular battle
would ensue. After advancing one day’s march, he saw
that the Parthians were spreading themselves around him
and seeking to attack him on the march, on which he
hung out in the camp the sign of battle, but at the same
time he ordered the tents to be taken down, as if his intention
were not to fight but to lead off his troops; and
he passed along the line of the barbarians, which was in
the form of a crescent, having given orders, as soon as the
first ranks of the enemy should be within reach of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>heavy-armed soldiers, for the cavalry to ride at them. To
the Parthians who stood opposed to the Romans, their
discipline appeared to be something indescribable; and
they observed the Romans as they marched past at equal
intervals without disorder and in silence, brandishing
their spears. But when the standard was raised and the
cavalry facing about rushed upon the enemy, the Parthians
received their onset and repelled it, though the
Romans were all at once too close to allow them to use
their arrows; but when the heavy-armed soldiers joined
in the conflict at the same time with shouts and the clatter
of arms, the Parthian horses were frightened and gave
way and the Parthians fled before they came to close
quarters. Antonius pressed on the pursuit, and had great
hopes that he had finished the whole war or the chief part
in that battle. But when the infantry had followed up
the pursuit for fifty stadia and the cavalry for three times
that distance, looking at those of the enemy who had fallen
and were captured, they found only thirty captives and
eighty corpses, which caused dismay and despondency in
all the army, when they reflected that though victorious
they had killed so few, and that when defeated they must
sustain such a loss as they had near the waggons. On
the following day they broke up their encampment and
took the road towards Phraata and the camp. On their
march they fell in at first with a few of the enemy, and
then a greater number, and finally with all, who, as if
they were unvanquished and fresh, challenged them and
fell upon them from all sides, so that with difficulty and
much labour they got safe to their camp. As the Medes
made a sally against the mound and terrified those who
were defending it, Antonius being enraged put in practice
what is called decimation<a id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_409_409">409</a> against the cowards; for he
divided the whole number into tens, and put to death one
out of each ten who was chosen by lot; and to the rest
he ordered barley to be measured out, instead of wheat.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="j40"></a> The war was attended with great hardship to both
sides, and the future was still more alarming, as Antonius
was expecting famine, for it was no longer possible to get
forage without many of the soldiers being wounded and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>killed. Phraates knowing that the Parthians were able
to bear anything rather than to endure hardship in the
winter and to encamp in the open air, was afraid lest, if
the Romans held out and abided there, his troops would
leave him, as the atmosphere was beginning to grow heavy
after the autumnal equinox. Accordingly he planned
such a stratagem as this. The chiefs of the Parthians,<a id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_410_410">410</a>
both in the forages and on other occasions when they met
the Romans, made less vigorous resistance, both allowing
them to take some things and commending their valour in
that they were most courageous men, and were justly
admired by their king. After this, riding up nearer to
them, and quietly placing their horses near the Romans,
they would abuse Antonius, saying that though Phraates
wished to come to terms and to spare so many brave men,
Antonius would not give him the opportunity, but sat
there awaiting those dangerous and powerful enemies,
hunger and winter, from whom it would be difficult for
them to escape, even under convoy of the Parthians. Many
persons reported this to Antonius, and though he was softened
by hope, still he did not send heralds to the Parthians
until he inquired from the barbarians who assumed
this friendly demeanour, whether what they said really
expressed the king’s meaning. On their saying that it
was so, and urging him not to fear or distrust, he sent
some of his companions to demand back the standards and
the captives, that it might not be supposed that he was so
eager to make his escape and get away. The Parthian
told him not to trouble himself about that matter, but
promised him peace and security if he would depart forthwith;
whereupon in a few days Antonius got his baggage
together and broke up his camp. Though Antonius had
great powers of persuasion before a popular assembly, and
was skilled above every man of the age in leading an army
by his words, he was unable through shame and depression
of spirits to encourage the soldiers, and he bade Domitius
Ænobarbus<a id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_411_411">411</a> do this. Some of the soldiers took this amiss,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>considering it as a token of contempt towards them,
but the majority were affected by it, and perceived
the reason, and they thought that they ought on this
account the more to show their respect and obedience to
the commander.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="j41"></a> As Antonius was intending to lead the troops
back by the same road, which was through a plain country
without trees, a man, by nation a Mardian,<a id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_412_412">412</a> who was well
acquainted with the Parthian habits, and had already
shown himself faithful to the Romans in the battle at the
waggons, came up to Antonius and advised him in his
flight to keep to the mountains on his right, and not to
expose a force, in heavy armour and encumbered, to so numerous
a cavalry and to the arrows in bare and open
tracts, which was the very thing that Phraates designed
when he induced him by friendly terms to raise the siege;
and that he would lead them a shorter road, where he
would find a better supply of necessaries. Antonius on
hearing this deliberated; he did not wish to appear to distrust
the Parthians after the truce, yet as he approved of
the shorter road, and the line of march being along inhabited
villages, he asked the Mardian for a pledge of his
fidelity. The Mardian offered himself to be put in chains
until he should place the army in Armenia; and he was
put in chains, and he conducted them for two days without
their meeting with any opposition. On the third day,
when Antonius had completely ceased to think of the Parthians,
and was advancing in a careless way by reason of
his confidence, the Mardian observed that an embankment
against the overflowing of a river had been recently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
broken, and that the stream was flowing in a great current
on the road by which they had to pass, and he knew
that the Parthians had done this with the intention of
making the river an obstacle to the Roman march by the
difficulty and delay that it would occasion; and he bade
Antonius look out and be on his guard, as the enemy was
near. Just while he was placing the heavy-armed men
in order, and taking measures for the javelin-men and
slingers to make an attack through their ranks upon the
enemy, the Parthians appeared and rode round them with
the design of encircling the Romans and putting them in
disorder on all sides. The light-armed troops made a sally
against them, and the Parthians, after inflicting some
wounds with their arrows and receiving as many from the
leaden bullets<a id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_413_413">413</a> and javelins of the Romans, retreated. The
Parthians then commenced a second attack, which continued
until the Celtæ in a mass drove their horses against
them and dispersed them; and the Parthians showed themselves
no more on that day.</p>
<p>XLII.<a id="j42"></a> From this experience Antonius, learning what he
ought to do, covered not only the rear, but also both flanks
with many javelin men and slingers, and led his army in
the form of a quadrangle; and the cavalry received orders
to repel the attack of the enemy, but when they had
repulsed them, not to pursue far, in consequence of which
the Parthians during the four following days sustained as
much damage as they inflicted, and their ardour being
dulled they thought of retiring, as an excuse for which
they alleged the approach of winter. On the fifth day
Flavius Gallus, a man of military talent and great activity,
who held a command, came and asked Antonius for more
light-armed troops for the rear,<a id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_414_414">414</a> and for some of the cavalry
from the van, in the expectation of having great success.
Antonius gave him the troops, and when the enemy made
his attack, he fell upon them, not as on former occasions,
at the same time withdrawing towards the heavy-armed
soldiers and retreating, but resisting them and engaging
with the enemy in a desperate way. The commanders of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>the rear seeing that he was being separated from them,
sent and called him back, but he would not listen to them.
They say that Titius the quæstor, seizing the standards,
turned them round and abused Gallus for throwing away
the lives of many brave men. But as Gallus abused him
in turn, and urged those about him to remain, Titius
retreated. While Gallus was pushing forwards against
the enemy in front, a large body of those in the rear got
round him before he perceived it. Being now attacked on
all sides he sent for aid; but the commanders of the heavy-armed
troops, among whom was Canidius, a man who had
the greatest influence with Antonius, are considered to
have committed a great mistake. For when they ought
to have moved the whole line against the enemy, they
sent a few at a time to help against them; and again
when these were being worsted, they sent others, and thus
these came near filling the whole army with defeat and
flight before they were aware of it; but Antonius himself
quickly came with the heavy-armed men from the van to
meet the enemy, and the third legion quickly pushing
through the fugitives against the enemy stopped their
further pursuit.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="j43"></a> There fell no fewer than three thousand; and
there were carried to the tents five thousand wounded,
and among them Gallus, who was pierced with five arrows
in front. Gallus did not recover from his wounds; but
Antonius, going about, visited the rest of the wounded, and
he encouraged them with tears in his eyes and deep sympathy.
The men, cheerfully grasping his right hand, begged
him to go and take care of his health and not to trouble
himself about them, calling him Imperator, and saying that
they were all secure if he was only safe. For altogether
it seems that no Imperator of that age got together an army
more distinguished by courage or endurance or strength;
but the respect towards the commander himself, and the
obedience combined with affection, and the circumstance
that all alike, those of good reputation, those of bad,
commanders, private soldiers, preferred honour and favour
from Antonius to their own lives and safety, left nothing
even for the ancient Romans to surpass, and of this there
were several reasons, as we have said before; noble birth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
powerful eloquence, simplicity, generosity and munificence,
affability in his pleasures and conversation. On that
occasion, by the pains that he took and his sympathy with
the wounded, and by sharing with them whatever they
wanted, he made the sick and wounded more full of alacrity
than those who were whole.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="j44"></a> However the victory so elated the enemy, who
were already worn out and exhausted, and they despised
the Romans so much that they even passed the night<a id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_415_415">415</a> close
to the camp, expecting that they should soon plunder the
deserted tents and the baggage of the Romans skulking
away. At daybreak the enemy crowded upon them in
still greater numbers, and there are said to have been not
fewer than forty thousand horseman, as the king had sent
even those who were always placed around himself, as to
certain and secure success; for the king himself was never
present in any battle. But Antonius, wishing to harangue
the soldiers, asked for a dark garment that he might appear
more piteous. But as his friends opposed him, he came
forward in the purple dress of a general and addressed the
troops, praising those who had been victorious, and upbraiding
those who had fled. The former exhorted him to
be of good cheer, and the others making their apology
offered themselves to him either to be decimated or to be
punished in any other way; only they prayed him to cease
being troubled and grieved. Hereupon, raising his hands,
he prayed to the gods, that if any reverse of fortune should
follow on account of his former prosperity, it might come
upon him, but that they would give safety and victory to
the rest of the army.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="j45"></a> On the following day they advanced under better
protection; and when the Parthians made their attack, the
result was very contrary to their expectations. For they
expected to advance to plunder and booty, and not to battle;
but as they were assailed by many missiles, and saw that
the Romans were encouraged and fresh with alacrity, they
were again completely wearied of the contest. However
the Parthians again fell upon them as they were descending
some steep hills, and galled them with arrows as they were
slowly retreating, whereon the shield-bearers<a id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_416_416">416</a> faced about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>and placing the light-armed troops within their ranks,
dropped down on one knee and held their shields before
them; those behind held their shields before the front
rank, and those who were behind the second rank did the
same. This form, which very much resembles a roof,<a id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_417_417">417</a>
presents a theatrical appearance, and is the safest of bulwarks
against the arrows, which thus glance off. But the
Parthians, who thought that the Romans bending on one
knee was a sign of exhaustion and fatigue, laid aside their
bows, and grasping their spears by the middle, came to
close quarters. But the Romans with one shout all at once
sprang up, and pushing with their javelins which they held
in their hands, killed the foremost and put all the rest to
flight. This took place also on the following days, the
Romans making only small way. Famine also attacked
the army, which could get little grain and that with fighting,
and they had few implements for grinding; for the
greater part were left behind, owing to some of the beasts
dying, and others being employed in carrying the sick
and wounded. It is said that an Attic chœnix<a id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_418_418">418</a> of wheat
was sold for fifty drachmæ; and they sold barley loaves
for their weight in silver. Then they betook themselves
to vegetables and roots; but they found few of the kind
that they were accustomed to, and being compelled to make
trial of what they had never tasted before, they ate of one
herb that caused madness and then death. For he who had
eaten of it recollected nothing, and understood nothing,
and busied himself about nothing except one sole thing,
which was to move and turn every stone, as if he were
doing something of great importance. The plain was full
of men stooping to the ground and digging round stones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
and moving them; and finally they vomited bile and died,
for wine, which was the only remedy, failed them. As
many were dying and the Parthians did not desist from
their attack, they say that Antonius often cried out “O the
ten thousand!”<a id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_419_419">419</a> whereby he expressed his admiration of
the ten thousand, that though they marched even a greater
distance, from Babylonia, and fought with many more
enemies, yet they made good their retreat.</p>
<p>XLVI.<a id="j46"></a> The Parthians, not being able to break through
the Roman army nor yet to separate their ranks, and being
already often defeated and put to flight, again mingled in a
friendly way with those who went out for grass or corn,
and pointing to the strings of their bows which were
unstrung, said, that they were going back and this was the
end of their attack; but that a few of the Medes would
follow still one or two days’ journey without annoying them
at all, and for the purpose of protecting the more distant
villages. To these words were added embraces and signs
of friendship, so that the Romans were again of good cheer;
and Antonius hearing this resolved to keep nearer to the
plains, as the road through the mountains was said to be
waterless. While he was intending to do this, there came
to the camp a man from the enemy, named Mithridates, a
cousin of Monæses, of him who had been with Antonius
and had received the three cities as a present. And he
asked for some one to come near to him who could speak
the Parthian or the Syrian language. Alexander of
Antioch came to him, and he was an intimate friend of
Antonius, whereupon Mithridates, saying who he was, and
intimating that they must thank Monæses for what he was
going to say, asked Alexander, if he saw in the distance a
continuous range of lofty mountains. On Alexander
saying that he saw them, he replied, “Under those
mountains the Parthians with all their forces lie in ambush
for you. For the great plains border on these mountains,
and they expect that you will be deceived by them and
will turn in that direction and leave the road through the
mountains. The way over the mountains is attended with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>thirst and labour to which you are accustomed, but if
Antonius goes by the plain, let him be assured that the fate
of Crassus awaits him.”</p>
<p>XLVII.<a id="j47"></a> Having said this, he went away; and Antonius,
who was troubled at these words, called together his friends
and the Mardian who was their guide, and had exactly the
same opinion. For even if there were no enemy, he knew
that the want of roads in the plains and the mistakes in
the track which they might make there were matters of
hazard and difficulty; but he declared that the road over
the mountains presented no other risk than the want of
water for a single day. Accordingly Antonius turned
aside and led his army by this route by night, having given
orders to the men to take water with them. But the
greater part had no vessels, and accordingly they filled
their helmets with water and carried them, and others took
it in skins. As soon as Antonius began to advance, the
Parthians had intelligence of it, and contrary to their
custom they commenced the pursuit while it was still night.
Just as the sun was rising, they came up with the rear,
which was in weak condition through want of sleep and
fatigue: for they had accomplished two hundred and forty
stadia in the night; and the enemy coming upon them so
suddenly when they did not expect it, dispirited them.
The contest increased their thirst, for they still advanced
while they were defending themselves. Those who were
in the first ranks, as they were marching onwards, came to
a river,<a id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_420_420">420</a> the water of which was cool and pellucid, but salt
and of a medicinal nature; and this water, when drank of
immoderately, caused pains with purging and augmentation
of the thirst: and though the Mardian had warned them
of this, the soldiers nevertheless forced away those who
tried to hinder them and drank of the water. Antonius
went round to the men and prayed them to hold out for a
short time, and he said there was another river not far off,
and besides this, the rest of the route was impracticable for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>horses and rough, so that the enemy must certainly turn
back. At the same time he summoned those who were
engaged in the fight and gave the signal for pitching the
tents, that the soldiers might at least enjoy the shade a little.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="j48"></a> While then the tents were being fixed and the
Parthians as usual were immediately retiring, Mithridates
came again, and upon Alexander going up to him, he advised
him to put the army in motion after it had rested a
little and to hasten to the river: for he said that the
Parthians would not cross it, but would follow up the
pursuit as far as the river. Alexander reported this to
Antonius, and then brought out from him numerous gold
cups and goblets, of which Mithridates taking as many as
he could hide in his dress, rode off. As it was still daylight,
they broke up their tents and advanced, without
being annoyed by the enemy; but they made that night
of all others the most painful and frightful to themselves.
For they killed and plundered those who had silver or
gold, and took the things that were carried by the beasts;
and finally falling upon the baggage of Antonius, they cut
in pieces and divided among them cups and costly tables,
there being great disturbance and confusion through the
whole army; for they thought that the enemy had fallen
upon them and that flight and dispersion had ensued,
Antonius called one of the freedmen, who was on his guard,
named Rhamnus, and bound him by oath when he gave
him the order, to push his sword through him and to cut off
his head, that he might neither be taken alive by the
enemy nor be recognised when dead. His friends broke
out in tears, but the Mardian encouraged Antonius by
telling him that the river was near; for a moist
breeze blowing and a cooler air meeting them made their
respiration more agreeable; and he said that the time they
had been on the march confirmed his estimate of the
distance, for what now remained of the night was not
much. At the same time others reported that the disorder
was owing to their own wrongful deeds and rapacity.
Accordingly Antonius, wishing to bring the army
into order from their state of disorder and confusion,
commanded the signal to be given for pitching the tents.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="j49"></a> Day was now dawning, and as the army <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>was
beginning to get into certain order and tranquillity, the
arrows of the Parthians fell upon the rear, and the signal
for battle was given to the light-armed troops. The
heavy-armed troops again covering one another in like
manner as before with their shields, stood the assault of
the missiles, the enemy not venturing to come near. The
first ranks advancing slowly in this form, the river was
seen; and Antonius drawing up his cavalry on the banks
in face of the enemy, took across the weak first. Those
who were fighting were now relieved from apprehension,
and had the opportunity of drinking; for when the
Parthians saw the river, they unstrung their bows and
bade the Romans pass over in confidence, with great
encomiums on their valour. Accordingly, they crossed,
and recruited themselves quietly; and then they marched
forwards, but yet not with full confidence in the Parthians.
On the sixth day after the last battle they reached the
river Araxes,<a id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_421_421">421</a> which is the boundary between Media and
Armenia. It appeared dangerous both for its depth and
roughness, and a rumour went through the army that the
enemy was in ambush there, and would fall on them as
they were crossing. When they had safely crossed and
had set foot in Armenia, as if they had just got sight of
that land from the sea, they saluted it and fell to shedding
of tears and embracing of one another for joy. In their
progress through a fertile country, during which they used
everything freely after having suffered great want, they
were subject to dropsical and bowel complaints.</p>
<p>L.<a id="j50"></a> Antonius there made a review of his men, and he
found that twenty thousand infantry and four thousand
cavalry had perished; not all by the enemy, but above
half by disease. They marched from Phraata twenty-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>seven
days, and they defeated the Parthians in eighteen
battles; but these victories brought neither strength nor
security, because their pursuits were short and ineffectual.
And this mainly showed that it was Artavasdes<a id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_422_422">422</a> the
Armenian who had deprived Antonius of the means of
bringing that war to an end. For if the sixteen thousand
horsemen whom he drew out of Media had been present,
who were equipped like the Parthians, and were accustomed
to fight against them, and if, while the Romans put to
flight the fighting enemy, they had overtaken the
fugitives, it would not have been in their power after a
defeat to recover themselves and venture again so often.
All the army accordingly in passion endeavoured to incite
Antonius to punish the Armenian. But Antonius upon
considerations of prudence neither reproached him for his
treachery nor abated of his usual friendly behaviour and
respect towards him, being weak in numbers and in want
of supplies. Afterwards, however, when he again broke
into Armenia, and by many promises and invitations,
persuaded Artavasdes to come into his hands, he seized
him and took him in chains to Alexandria, where he was
led in triumph. And herein chiefly he offended the Romans,
by giving to the Egyptians for the sake of Cleopatra the
honourable and solemn ceremonial of his native country.
This however took place later.</p>
<p>LI.<a id="j51"></a> Antonius now pressed on his march, the winter
having already set in with severity, through incessant
snow-storms, in which he lost eight thousand men on the
route. Going down to the sea-coast with a very small
body of men, he waited for Cleopatra<a id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_423_423">423</a> in a place between
Berytus and Sidon, called “White village”; and as she was
slow in coming, he became uneasy and restless, soon giving
himself up to drinking and intoxication, but yet being
unable to continue at table; for while his companions were
drinking he would rise and often spring up to look out,
till Cleopatra arrived there by sea bringing a quantify of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>clothes and supplies for the soldiers. There are some who
say that Antonius received the clothes from her, but that
the money was his own, though he distributed it as if it
were a present to him from Cleopatra.</p>
<p>LII.<a id="j52"></a> A quarrel arose between the king of the Medes
and Phraortes<a id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_424_424">424</a> the Parthian, which originated, as they say,
about the Roman spoils, but caused the Mede to have suspicions
and fear of being deprived of his dominions. For
this reason he sent to invite Antonius, and proffered to
join him in a war with his own forces. Antonius accordingly
being put in great hope—for the only thing as he
thought which had been the cause of his failing to subdue
the Parthians, his having gone against them without many
horsemen and bowmen, he now saw was offered to him in
such way that his part was rather to do a favour by
accepting than to ask for one—was preparing again to
march into the upper country through Armenia, and
after joining the Mede near the Araxes, then to recommence
the war.</p>
<p>LIII.<a id="j53"></a> At Rome Octavia<a id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_425_425">425</a> was desirous of going to Antonius,
and Cæsar gave her permission; as the greater
part say, not with the design of pleasing her, but in order
that if she were greatly insulted and neglected, he might
have a specious pretext for the war. On reaching Athens
she received letters from Antonius, in which he told her
to stay there, and informed her of his intended expedition.
Though Octavia was annoyed, and saw that this was only
a pretext, she wrote to him to ask to what place he would
have the things sent which she was bringing to him.
And she was taking a great quantity of clothing for the
army, many beasts, and money and presents for his officers
and friends; and besides this, two thousand picked soldiers
equipped as prætorian cohorts, with splendid armour. A
certain Niger, a friend of Antonius, who was sent by
Octavia, reported this to him, and he added commendation
of Octavia such as she merited and was just. But Cleopatra,
seeing that Octavia was entering into a contest
with her, and fearing that if to the dignity of her behaviour
and the power of Cæsar she added the pleasure of social
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>intercourse and attention to Antonius, she would be invincible
and get complete mastery over her husband, pretended
to be desperately in love with Antonius, and she
wasted her body by spare diet; and she put on the expression
of strong passion when he approached her, and of
sorrow and depression when he went away. She also contrived
to be often seen in tears, which she would all at
once wipe away and affect to conceal, as if she did not wish
Antonius to observe it. She practised these arts while
Antonius was preparing for his expedition from Syria
against the Mede.<a id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_426_426">426</a> Flatterers, too, who were busy in her
behalf, abused Antonius as a hard and unfeeling man, who
was causing the death of a woman who was devoted to him
alone. As to Octavia, she came to meet Antonius upon
business on her brother’s account, and enjoyed the name
of wife of Antonius; but Cleopatra, who was the queen of
so many people, was only called the beloved of Antonius,
and she did not shun nor disdain this name, so long as she
could see Antonius and live with him; but if she were
driven away from him, she would not survive. At last
they so melted and softened the man, that through fear
that Cleopatra might destroy herself, he returned to Alexandria,
and put off the Mede to the summer season, though
the affairs of Parthia were said to be in a state of anarchy.
However, he went up into the country, and brought over
the king to friendly terms, and after betrothing to one of
his sons by Cleopatra one of the daughters of the king,
who was still a young child, he returned, being now
engaged in preparing for the civil war.</p>
<p>LIV.<a id="j54"></a> When Octavia returned from Athens, as Cæsar
conceived her to have been insulted, he ordered her to
dwell in her own house. But she refused to leave her
husband’s house, and she advised her brother, if he had
not for other reasons determined to go to war with Antonius,
to let her affairs alone, for it was not even decent
to be said, that of the greatest Imperators, one through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>love for a woman, and the other through jealousy, brought
the Romans to civil war. This she said, and she confirmed
what she said by her acts; for she lived in her
husband’s house, just as if he were at home, and she took
care of the children, both her own and those of Fulvia, in
an honourable and liberal way; she also received the
friends of Antonius who were sent to Rome to get offices
or on business, and assisted them in obtaining from Cæsar
what they wanted. She thus unintentionally damaged
Antonius, for he was hated for wronging such a woman.
He was also hated for the division which he made among
his children at Alexandria, which appeared to be tragical<a id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_427_427">427</a>
and arrogant, and to show hatred of the Romans. For he
filled the gymnasium with a crowd, and caused to be placed
on a tribunal of silver two thrones of gold, one for himself,
and the other for Cleopatra, and for the children other
thrones which were lower; and first of all he declared
Cleopatra Queen of Egypt and Cyprus and Libya and
Cœle Syria, with Cæsarion as co-regent, who was believed
to be the son of the former Cæsar, who left Cleopatra pregnant;
in the next place he proclaimed his sons and Cleopatra’s
to be Kings of Kings; and to Alexander he gave
Armenia, and Media, and Parthia, when he should have
subdued it, and to Ptolemæus he gave Phœnice and Syria
and Cilicia. At the same time also he led forth Alexander,
dressed in a Median vest with a tiara and cittaris<a id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_428_428">428</a> upright,
and Ptolemæus in boots, and a chlamys, and a causia with
a diadem attached to it; for this was the dress of the kings
who followed Alexander, and the other was the dress of
the Medes and Armenians. After the children had embraced
their parents, a guard of Armenians was placed
around the one, and of Macedonians around the other.
Cleopatra, both on that occasion and on other occasions
when she went out before the people, used to put on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>dress sacred to Isis, different from her ordinary dress, and
she was called the new Isis.</p>
<p>LV.<a id="j55"></a> By bringing these matters before the Senate, and
often complaining of them before the people, Cæsar excited
the multitude against Antonius. Antonius also sent and
made recriminations against Cæsar. The chief charges
which Antonius made against him were, in the first place,
that though he had taken Sicily from Pompeius, he did not
give him a part of the island; second, that Cæsar had borrowed
ships from him for the war and had kept them;
third, that after ejecting his colleague Lepidus from his
authority and degrading him, Cæsar kept the army and
territory and revenues that were assigned to Lepidus;<a id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_429_429">429</a>
and, finally, that he had distributed nearly all Italy in
allotments among his own soldiers, and had left nothing
for the soldiers of Antonius. To these charges Cæsar
replied, that he had deprived Lepidus of his authority
because he was abusing it, and as to what he had acquired
in war, he would share it with Antonius, when Antonius
should share Armenia with him. He further said that the
soldiers of Antonius had no claim to any share of Italy,
for that they had Media and Parthia, which they had
added to the Roman possessions by their brave conduct in
war under their Imperator.</p>
<p>LVI.<a id="j56"></a> Antonius heard of this while he was tarrying in
Armenia; and he immediately gave orders to Canidius to
take sixteen legions and to go down to the sea. Himself
taking Cleopatra with him went to Ephesus. Here the
navy collected from all quarters, eight hundred ships,
including merchant vessels, of which Cleopatra furnished
two hundred, and twenty thousand talents and supplies
for the war for all the army. Antonius, being persuaded
by Domitius and some others, told Cleopatra to sail to
Egypt and there to wait the result of the war. But as
Cleopatra feared that there would again be a reconciliation
through Octavia, she persuaded Canidius by a large bribe
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>to speak to Antonius about her, and to say, that it was
neither just for a woman to be kept away from the war,
who supplied so many large contributions, nor was it to
the interest of Antonius to dispirit the Egyptians, who
composed a large part of the naval force; and besides this,
he did not see to which of the kings who joined the expedition
Cleopatra was inferior in understanding, she who
for a long time by herself had governed so large a kingdom,
and had long enjoyed his company, and had learned
to manage great affairs. These arguments prevailed, for
it was fated that all the power should come into Cæsar’s
hands; and after the forces had come together, they sailed
to Samos and enjoyed themselves there. For as orders
had been given to kings and rulers and tetrarchs and
nations and all the cities between Syria and the Mæotis
and Armenia and the Illyrians<a id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_430_430">430</a> to send and bring their
supplies for the war, so all the persons who assisted at
theatrical entertainments were required to meet Antonius
at Samos; and while nearly all the world around was
lamenting and groaning, one island for many days resounded
with pipes and stringed instruments, and the
theatres were filled and the chori were vying with one
another. Every city also joined in the celebration by
sending an ox, and kings rivalled one another in giving
entertainments and presents. So that it went abroad and
was said, how will persons behave in the rejoicings after a
victory, who make such costly banquets to celebrate the
preparations for war?</p>
<p>LVII.<a id="j57"></a> After these amusements were over, Antonius
gave to the theatrical company Priene for their dwelling;
and sailing to Athens he again gave himself up to pleasure
and theatres. Cleopatra, who was jealous of the honours
that had been paid to Octavia in the city, for Octavia was
very much beloved by the Athenians, attempted to gain
the popular favour by many acts of liberality. The
Athenians after voting to her honorable distinctions, sent
a deputation to her residence to carry the record of the
vote, and Antonius was one of them, as being an Athenian
citizen; and coming before her he went through an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>harangue on behalf of the city. He sent persons to Rome
to eject Octavia from his house; and it is said that when
she left it, she took all the children of Antonius with her
except the eldest of the children by Fulvia, for he was
with his father, and that she wept and lamented that she
too would be considered one of the causes of the war. And
the Romans pitied not her, but they pitied Antonius, and
those chiefly who had seen Cleopatra, a woman who had
not the advantage over Octavia either in beauty or in
youth.</p>
<p>LVIII.<a id="j58"></a> Cæsar was alarmed when he heard of the
rapidity and the greatness of the preparation<a id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_431_431">431</a> of Antonius,
lest he should be compelled to come to a decisive battle
during that summer. For he was deficient in many
things, and the exaction of taxes vexed people; for the
free men, being compelled to contribute a fourth<a id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_432_432">432</a> of their
income, and the class of freedmen to contribute an eighth
part of their property, cried out against Cæsar, and tumults
arising from these causes prevailed over all Italy. Accordingly
the delay in the war is reckoned among the
greatest faults of Antonius; for it gave time to Cæsar to
make preparation, and it put an end to the disturbances
among the people; for while the money was being exacted
from them they were irritated, but when it had been
exacted and they had paid it they remained quiet.<a id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_433_433">433</a> Titius
and Plancus, friends of Antonius and men of consular
rank, being insulted by Cleopatra, for they made the most
opposition to her joining the expedition, escaped to Cæsar,
and they gave him information about the will of Antonius,
as they were acquainted with the contents of it. The will
was placed with the Vestal Virgins,<a id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_434_434">434</a> and when Cæsar asked
for it, they would not give it to him, but they told him, if
he wished to have it, to come and take it himself. And
he did go and take it; and first of all he read it over by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>himself, and marked certain passages which furnished
ready matter of accusation; in the next place he assembled
the Senate and read the will, to the dissatisfaction of the
greater part; for they considered it to be altogether
unusual and a hard matter for a man to be called to
account in his lifetime for what he wished to be done
after his death. Cæsar dwelt most on that part of the will
which related to the interment; for Antonius directed
that his body, even if he should die in Rome, should be
carried in procession through the Forum and sent to
Alexandria to Cleopatra. Calvisius, an intimate friend of
Cæsar, brought forward also these charges against Antonius
in reference to Cleopatra: that he had given her
the libraries<a id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_435_435">435</a> from Pergamum, in which there were two
hundred thousand single books; and that at an entertainment
in the presence of many people he stood up and
rubbed her feet<a id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_436_436">436</a> in compliance with a certain arrangement
and agreement; and that he allowed the Ephesians in his
presence to salute Cleopatra as mistress; and that frequently
when he was administering justice to tetrarchs
and kings on his tribunal, he would receive from her love-billets
written on onyx or crystal and read them. Furnius<a id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_437_437">437</a>
also, who was a man of distinction and the most powerful
orator among the Romans, said that Cleopatra was being
carried in a litter through the Forum, and that Antonius
when he saw her, sprung up and left the judgment-seat
and accompanied her hanging on the litter.</p>
<p>LIX.<a id="j59"></a> In most of these matters Calvisius<a id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_438_438">438</a> was supposed
to be lying. But the friends of Antonius going about in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>Rome entreated the people for his sake, and they sent
Geminius, one of their body, to entreat Antonius not to be
regardless about being deprived of his authority by a vote
and declared an enemy of the Romans. Geminius having
sailed to Greece became suspected by Cleopatra of acting on
the behalf of Octavia, and, though he was continually ridiculed
at supper and insulted by having unsuitable places
at the feast assigned to him, he submitted to this and
waited for an opportunity of an interview; and when he
was told at supper to say what he had come about, he
replied that all his communication was to be made when
he was sober, except one thing, which he knew whether
he was sober or drunk; and it was this, that all would be
well if Cleopatra would go off to Egypt. Antonius was
irritated at this, but Cleopatra said, “You have done well,
Geminius, in having confessed the truth without tortures.”
After a few days accordingly Geminius made his
escape to Rome. The flatterers of Cleopatra drove away
also many of the other friends of Antonius, who could not
endure their excesses over wine and their coarse behaviour;
and among these were Marcus Silanus and Dellius
the historian. Dellius says that he was also afraid of some
design from Cleopatra, of which he had been informed by
Glaucus the physician. He had offended Cleopatra at
supper by saying that they had to drink vinegar, while
Sarmentus<a id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_439_439">439</a> at Rome was drinking Falernian. Now Sarmentus
was a youth, one of Cæsar’s favourites, such as the
Romans call Deliciæ.</p>
<p>LX.<a id="j60"></a> When Cæsar had made preparation sufficient, he
got a vote passed for war against Cleopatra<a id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_440_440">440</a> and for depriving
Antonius of the authority which he had surrendered
to Cleopatra. Cæsar also said that Antonius, owing
to draughts that had been administered to him, was not in
his senses, and those whom the Romans had to fight
against were Mardion the eunuch, and Potheinus, and Iras
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>the tire-woman of Cleopatra, and Charmion, by whom all
the chief matters of administration were directed. These
signs, it is said, happened before the war. Pisaurum,<a id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_441_441">441</a> a
city that had been colonised by Antonius, which was
situated near the Adriatic, was swallowed up by the opening
of chasms in the earth. From one of the stone statues
of Antonius at Alba sweat oozed for many days, and
it did not cease, though there were persons who wiped it
off. While he was staying at Patræ, the Herakleium was
destroyed by lightning; at Athens the Dionysius, one of
the figures in the Battle of the Giants,<a id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_442_442">442</a> was blown down
by the winds and carried into the theatre. Now Antonius
claimed kinship with Hercules by descent and with Dionysius
by imitating his manner of life, as it has been said,
and he was called young Dionysius. The same tempest
also fell on the colossal statues of Eumenes and Attalus,
on which the name of Antonius had been inscribed, and
threw them down alone out of a large number. The
admiral’s ship of Cleopatra was called Antonias, and a bad
omen appeared as to it: some swallows had made their
nest under the stern, but other swallows attacked and
drove them out and destroyed the young.</p>
<p>LXI.<a id="j61"></a> They were now coming together for the war;
and the fighting ships of Antonius were not fewer than
five hundred, among which were many vessels of eight
and ten banks of oars fitted out in proud and pompous
style; of the land forces there were one hundred thousand,
and twelve thousand horsemen. There were on his side
of subject kings, Bocchus the king of the Libyans, and
Tarcondemus the king of Upper Cilicia, and Archelaus,
king of Cappadocia, and Philadelphus of Paphlagonia, and
Mithridates of Commagene, and Sadalas of Thrace. These
were with him. From Pontus Polemon sent a force, and
Malchus from Arabia, and Herodes, the Jew; and besides
these, Amyntas, the king of the Lycaonians and Galatians.<a id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_443_443">443</a>
There was also help sent from the king of the Medes.
Cæsar had two hundred and fifty ships of war, and eighty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>thousand infantry, and about the same number of horsemen
as the enemy. The dominion of Antonius extended
over the country from the Euphrates to the Ionian sea
and the Illyrians; and that of Cæsar from the Illyrians
over the country that reached to the Western Ocean, and
over the country from the ocean to the Tuscan and Sicilian
sea. Of Libya Cæsar had the part which extended opposite
to Italy and Gaul and Iberia as far as the pillars of
Hercules; and Antonius had the part from Cyrene to
Ethiopia.</p>
<p>LXII.<a id="j62"></a> Antonius was so mere an appendage to Cleopatra
that though he had a great superiority in land forces, he
wished the decision of the affair to depend on the navy,
to please Cleopatra: and this, though he saw that through
want of a crew, men were being seized by the trierarchs
out of Greece, which had indeed suffered much, travellers,
ass-drivers, reapers, youths, and that even by these means
the ships were not manned, but the greater part were deficient
and were ill manœuvred. Cæsar’s navy consisted
of ships not built to a great height nor yet for the purpose
of making a show, but adapted for easy and quick movement
and well manned; and he kept his fleet together in
Tarentum and Brundusium, and sent to Antonius to ask
him not to waste the time, but to come with his forces, and
that he would provide his armament with naval stations
free from all hindrance, and harbours, and that he would
retreat with his land forces a day’s journey for a horseman
from the sea, until Antonius had safely landed and encamped.
Antonius replied in like strain to this bragging
language by challenging Cæsar to single combat, though
he was older than Cæsar; and if Cæsar declined this, he proposed
that they should decide the matter with their
armies at Pharsalus, as Cæsar and Pompeius had done
before. While Antonius was taking his station near
Actium,<a id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_444_444">444</a> where Nicopolis is now built, Cæsar contrived to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>cross the Ionian sea and to get possession of a place in
Epirus, called Torune; and as the friends of Antonius
were uneasy, because their land force had not yet come
up, Cleopatra, jesting, said, “What is the harm if Cæsar is
sitting by a torune?”<a id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_445_445">445</a></p>
<p>LXIII.<a id="j63"></a> At daybreak the advance of the enemy’s fleet
alarmed Antonius, lest they should seize the ships which
were without crews, and accordingly he armed the rowers
and placed them on the decks to make a show, and raising
the ships’ oars and making them ready for plying, he
kept his ships on each side in the channel near Actium,
prow to prow, as if they were fit to be put in motion and
prepared to fight. Cæsar, being frustrated by this manœuvre,
retired. Antonius also by some well contrived
works shut in the water and deprived his enemies of it;
and the surrounding spots had only little water, and that
was bad. He behaved with magnanimity to Domitius
also, and contrary to the judgment of Cleopatra. Domitius,
who was already suffering from fever, got into a small
boat and went over to Cæsar, on which Antonius, though
much annoyed, sent him all his baggage together with his
friends and slaves. Domitius indeed, as if he were repenting
after the discovery of his faithlessness and treachery,
died immediately. There were also defections among the
kings, for Amyntas and Deiotarus went over to Cæsar.
Now as the navy was in all things unlucky and always
too late to give any help, Antonius was again compelled
to turn his thoughts to his land forces. Canidius also,
who commanded the land forces, changed his opinion at
the sight of the danger, and he advised Antonius to send
Cleopatra away, and to retreat to Thrace or Macedonia,
and then to decide the matter by a battle. For Dicomes,
the king of the Getæ, promised to help him with a large
force; and Canidius urged that there would be no disgrace,
if they should give up the sea to Cæsar, who had
been disciplined in the Sicilian war, but it would be a
strange thing if Antonius, who was excellently versed in
military operations, should not avail himself of his strength
and his resources of so many heavy-armed soldiers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>should instead thereof distribute his troops among vessels
and fritter them away. Notwithstanding this the advice
of Cleopatra prevailed that the war should be decided by
a naval battle, though she was already contemplating
flight and making arrangements for her own position, not
with a view to contribute to the victory, but to have the
best place to retreat from if their cause should be ruined.
Now there were long lines which extended from the camp
to the naval station, and Antonius was accustomed to pass
without suspecting any danger; and as a slave of Cæsar
told him that it would be possible to seize Antonius as he
went down through the lines, Cæsar sent men to lie in
ambush for him. They came so near accomplishing their
purpose as this, that by rising up too soon they seized the
man who was advancing in front of Antonius; and
Antonius escaped with difficulty by running.</p>
<p>LXIV.<a id="j64"></a> When it had been resolved to make a sea fight,
Antonius burned all the Egyptian ships except sixty;
but he manned the best and largest, from three to ten
banks of oars, with twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers
and two thousand bowmen. Hereupon it is said that one
of the centurions, who had already fought many battles
for Antonius and was covered with wounds, wept as
Antonius was passing by, and said; “Imperator, why do you
distrust these wounds or this sword and rest your hopes
in miserable logs of wood? Let Egyptians and Phœnicians
fight on sea, but give us land, on which we are accustomed
to stand and to die or to vanquish our enemies.” Without
making any reply, but merely by a motion of his hand
and the expression of his countenance encouraging the
man to be of good cheer, Antonius passed by, without
however having any good hopes himself, inasmuch as
when the masters of the vessels were desirous to leave the
sails behind, he ordered them to be put on board and taken
with them, observing that not a single fugitive of the
enemy should be allowed to escape.</p>
<p>LXV.<a id="j65"></a><a id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_446_446">446</a> Now on that day and the three following days
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>the sea was agitated by a strong wind which prevented
an engagement, but on the fifth, there being no wind and
the sea being quite calm, they came to an engagement.
Antonius and Publicola commanded the right wing,
and Cœlius the left; and in the centre were Marcus
Octavius and Marcus Insteius. Cæsar placed Agrippa on
the left, and reserved the right wing for himself. Canidius
drew up the army of Antonius, and Taurus that of Cæsar
on the shore, and remained without moving. As to the two
commanders-in-chief, Antonius visited all his vessels in a
row-boat and exhorted his soldiers to trust to the weight
of their ships and to fight as if they were on land, without
changing their position, and he urged the masters of the
ships to receive the shock of the enemy with their vessels
as if they were quietly at anchor, and to avoid the difficult
spots about the entrance of the bay: and Cæsar, it is said,
while it was still dark, left his tent, and as he was going
round to the ships, he met a man driving an ass, who
being asked his name and knowing Cæsar, replied, “My
name is Goodluck, and my ass’s name is Victor.” For
this reason when Cæsar afterwards ornamented the place
with the beaks of ships, he set up a bronze figure of an
ass and a man. After observing the arrangement of the
other part of his fleet, he went in a boat to the right wing
and was surprised to see the enemy resting quietly in the
straits; for the vessels had the appearance of being
moored at their anchors; and as he was for a long time
convinced of this, he kept his own ships at the distance of
eight stadia from the enemy. It was now the sixth hour,
and a wind beginning to rise from the sea, the soldiers of
Antonius were impatient at the delay, and, trusting to the
height and magnitude of their ships as making them unassailable,
they put the left wing in motion. Cæsar, delighted
to see this, ordered his right wing to row backwards
with the design of drawing the enemy still further
out of the gulf and the straits, and by surrounding them
with his own light vessels to come to close quarters with
the enemy’s ships, which, owing to their size and the
insufficiency of their crews, were cumbersome and slow.</p>
<p>LXVI.<a id="j66"></a> Though the two fleets were beginning to come
together, they did not drive the ships against, nor <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>strive
to crush one another, for the ships of Antonius, owing to
their weight, were unable to move forwards with any
force, which mainly gives effect to the blows of the beaks,
and those of Cæsar not only avoided meeting front to
front the strong and rough brass work of the enemy, but
did not even venture to strike against them on the flank.
For the beaks would easily have been broken off by coming
in contact with the hulls<a id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_447_447">447</a> of the enemy’s vessels, which
were protected by large square pieces of timber fastened
to one another with iron. The battle therefore was like
a land fight, or, to speak more exactly, like the assailing of
a fortress; for three and four of Cæsar’s ships at the same
time were engaged about one of the ships of Antonius, and
the men fought with light shields and spears and poles
and fiery missiles; the soldiers of Antonius assailed them
also with catapults from wooden towers. While Agrippa
was extending the left wing with a view to surround the
enemy, Publicola, being compelled to advance to meet him,
was separated from the centre, which fell into confusion,
and was also closely engaged with Arruntius. While the
sea fight was still undecided and equally favourable to
both sides, all at once the sixty ships of Cleopatra were
seen raising their sails for the purpose of making off, and
flying through the centre of the combatants; for they
were stationed behind the large vessels and they caused
confusion by making their way through them. The
enemy looked on with wonder, seeing them take advantage
of the wind and shape their course towards the Peloponnesus.
On this occasion Antonius clearly showed that he
was not governed by the considerations that befit either a
commander or a man, or even by his own judgment, but,
as some one observed in jest, that the soul of the lover
lives in another person’s body, so was he dragged along
by the woman as if he had grown to her and moved together
with her. For no sooner did he see her ship sailing
away, than, forgetting everything, and deserting and
skulking away from those who were fighting and dying
in his cause, he got into a five-oared galley with only
Alexas the Syrian and Skellius to attend him, and followed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>after her who had already ruined him and was destined
to complete his ruin.</p>
<p>LXVII.<a id="j67"></a> Cleopatra, having recognised the vessel of
Antonius, raised a signal; and Antonius accordingly, coming
up to her and being taken into her ship, neither saw
Cleopatra nor was seen by her, but advancing close to the
prow he sat down by himself in silence holding his head
with both his hands. In the meantime there were seen
Liburnian ships<a id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_448_448">448</a> from Cæsar’s fleet in pursuit; but Antonius,
by ordering his men to turn his vessel’s head towards them,
kept them all in check, except the ship of Eurykles, the
Lacedæmonian, who proudly pressed on, brandishing a spear
on the deck, as if to hurl it at Antonius. Standing on the
prow of his vessel Antonius asked who it was that was
pursuing Antonius? The reply was, “I am Eurykles, the
son of Lachares, and by the help of Cæsar’s fortune I am
avenging my father’s death.” Now Lachares had been
beheaded by Antonius in consequence of being involved in
a charge of robbery. However Eurykles did not fall upon
the ship of Antonius, but he dashed against the other of
the admiral-ships (for there were two) with the brazen
beak, and made it spin round, and as the ship fell off from
its course he took it, and also another ship which contained
costly vessels for table use. When this assailant had
retired, Antonius, again settling down in the same posture,
remained without moving, and, after spending three days
at the prow by himself, either because of his passion or that
he was ashamed to see Cleopatra, he put in at Tænarus.<a id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_449_449">449</a>
Here the women who were in attendance on Cleopatra
first of all brought them to speak to one another, and next
they persuaded them to sup and sleep together. And
already not a few of the transport ships and some of their
friends after the defeat began to collect around them; and
they brought intelligence of the destruction of the navy, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>they supposed that the army still kept together. Antonius
sent messengers to Canidius with orders for him to retreat
quickly through Macedonia with his army into Asia; and
as it was his intention to cross over from Tænarus to Libya,
he selected one of the store-ships which conveyed much
money and many royal utensils in silver and in gold of
great value, and gave them to his friends, telling them to
divide the things among them and to look after their safety.
As they refused and wept, he comforted them with much
affection and kindness, and by his entreaties induced them
to depart; and he wrote to Theophilus, his steward in
Corinth, to provide for the safety of the men and to conceal
them until they should be able to make their peace with
Cæsar. This Theophilus was the father of Hipparchus,
who had the greatest influence with Antonius, and was
the first of his freedmen who went over to Cæsar, and he
afterwards lived in Corinth.</p>
<p>LXVIII.<a id="j68"></a> Such was the condition of affairs with Antonius.
At Actium the naval force, after resisting Cæsar a
long time and being very greatly damaged by the heavy
sea that set against them ahead, hardly gave up the contest
at the tenth hour. The dead were said not to be more
than five thousand, but there were taken three hundred
ships, as Cæsar has recorded. There were not many who
knew that Antonius had fled, and those who heard of it
could not at first believe that he had gone and left them,
when he had nineteen legions of unvanquished soldiers and
twelve thousand horsemen; as if he had not often experienced
fortune both ways, and were not exercised in the
reverses of innumerable contests and wars. The soldiers
longed and expected to see him, hoping that he would soon
show himself from some quarter or other; and they displayed
so much fidelity and courage that, even when his
flight was well known, they kept together seven days and
paid no regard to Cæsar’s messages to them. But at last,
when their general Canidius had stolen away by night and
left the camp, being now deserted of all and betrayed by
their commanders, they went over to the conqueror. Upon
this Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_450_450">450</a> sailed to Athens, and having come to terms with
the Greeks, he distributed the grain that remained over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>after the war among the cities, which were in a wretched
condition and stripped of money, slaves and beasts of
burden. Now my great-grandfather Nikarchus used to
relate that all the citizens<a id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_451_451">451</a> were compelled to carry down
on their shoulders a certain quantity of wheat to the sea
at Antikyra, and that their speed was quickened by the
whip; they had carried, he said, one supply in this manner,
and had just measured out another and were about to set
out, when news came that Antonius was defeated, and this
saved the city; for the agents and soldiers of Antonius
immediately fled, and they divided the corn among themselves.</p>
<p>LXIX.<a id="j69"></a> When Antonius had reached the coast of Libya,
and had sent Cleopatra forwards to Egypt from Parætonium,<a id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_452_452">452</a>
he had his fill of solitude, wandering and rambling
about with two friends, one a Greek, Aristokrates, a rhetorician,
and the other a Roman, Lucilius,<a id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_453_453">453</a> about whom I have
said elsewhere that at Philippi, in order that Brutus might
escape, he had surrendered to the pursuers, pretending that
he was Brutus, and his life being spared by Antonius on
that account, he remained faithful to him and firm to the
last critical times. When the general<a id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_454_454">454</a> to whom he had
intrusted the troops in Libya had caused their defection,
Antonius made an effort to kill himself, but he was prevented
by his friends and conveyed to Alexandria, where
he found Cleopatra contemplating a hazardous and great
undertaking. The isthmus which separates the Red Sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
from the sea of Egypt<a id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_455_455">455</a> and is considered to be the boundary
between Asia and Libya, in the part where it is most
contracted by the sea, and the width is least, is about three
hundred stadia across; and here Cleopatra undertook to raise
her ships out of the water and to drag them across the neck
of land, and so bringing her ships into the Arabian gulf
with much money and a large force, to settle beyond the
limits of Egypt and to escape from slavery and war. But
as the Arabs of Petra<a id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_456_456">456</a> burnt the first ships which were
drawn up, and Antonius thought that the army at Actium
still kept together, Cleopatra desisted from her design
and guarded the approaches to Egypt. Antonius now
leaving the city and the company of his friends, built for
himself a dwelling in the sea, near the Pharos,<a id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_457_457">457</a> by throwing
forward a mole into the water; and here he lived a fugitive
from men, and he said that he was content with Timon’s
life and admired it, considering himself in like plight with
Timon; for he too had been wronged by his friends and
had experienced their ingratitude, and that therefore he
distrusted and disliked all men.</p>
<p>LXX.<a id="j70"></a> Timon<a id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_458_458">458</a> was an Athenian, who lived about the
time of the Peloponnesian war, as we may conclude from
the plays of Aristophanes and Plato; for he is brought
forward in them as peevish and misanthropical. Though
he avoided and rejected all intercourse with men, yet he
received in a friendly manner Alkibiades, who was a young
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>audacious fellow, and showed him great affection. And
when Apemantus wondered at this and asked the reason,
he said that he liked the young man because he knew that
he would be the cause of much ill to the Athenians. Apemantus
was the only person whom he sometimes allowed
to approach him, because he was like himself and imitated
his mode of life. On one occasion, during the festival
called Choes,<a id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_459_459">459</a> when the two were feasting together, Apemantus
said, “How delightful the entertainment is,
Timon;” “Yes, if you were not here,” was the reply. It
is said that when the Athenians were in public assembly,
Timon ascended the bema and called for silence, which
raised great expectation on account of the unusual nature
of the circumstance: he then said, “I have a small plot
of building-ground, men of Athens, and there is a fig-tree
growing on it, on which many of the citizens have already
hanged themselves. Now as I intend to build on the
ground, I wished to give public notice that, if any of you
choose, they may hang themselves before the fig-tree is
cut down.” After his death he was buried at Halæ, near
the sea; but the shore in front of the place slipped down,
and the sea surrounding the tomb made it inaccessible and
unapproachable. The inscription on the tomb was:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Here from the load of life released I lie:</div>
<div class="line">Ask not my name: but take my curse, and die.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>And they say that he wrote this inscription during his
lifetime; but that which is commonly circulated as the
inscription is by Callimachus:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Timon misanthropist I am. Away!</div>
<div class="line">Curse, an’ thou will’t, but only do not stay.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>LXXI.<a id="j71"></a> These are a few things out of many about Timon.
Canidius himself brought intelligence to Antonius of the
loss of his forces at Actium, and he heard that Herodes,<a id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_460_460">460</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>the Jew, who had certain legions and cohorts, had gone
over to Cæsar, and that the rest of the princes in like
manner were revolting, and that none of his troops out of
Egypt still kept together. However, none of these things
disturbed him; but, as if he gladly laid aside hope as he
did care, he left that dwelling on the sea, which he called
Timoneium, and being taken by Cleopatra into the palace,
he turned the city to feasting and drinking and distribution
of money, registering the son of Cleopatra and Cæsar
among the young men, and putting on Antyllus, his son by
Fulvia,<a id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_461_461">461</a> the vest without the purple hem, which marked
the attainment of full age, on which occasion banquets
and revellings and feasts engaged Alexandria for many
days. They themselves put an end to that famed company
of the Inimitable Livers, and they formed another, not
at all inferior to that in refinement and luxury and expense,
which they called the company of those who would die
together. For the friends of Antonius registered themselves
as intending to die together, and they continued
enjoying themselves in a succession of banquets. Cleopatra
got together all kinds of deadly poisons, and she tried the
painless character of each by giving them to those who
were in prison under sentence of death. When she discovered
that the quick poisons brought on a speedy death
with pain, and the less painful were not quick, she made
trial of animals,<a id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_462_462">462</a> which in her presence were set upon one
another. And she did this daily; and among nearly all
she found that the bite of the asp alone brought on without
spasms and groans a sleepy numbness and drowsiness, with
a gentle perspiration on the face, and dulling of the perceptive
faculties, which were softly deprived of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>power, and made resistance to all attempts to awake and
arouse them, as is the case with those who are in a deep
sleep.</p>
<p>LXXII.<a id="j72"></a> At the same time they sent also ambassadors
to Cæsar into Asia, Cleopatra requesting the dominion of
Egypt for her children, and Antonius asking to be allowed
to live as a private person at Athens, if he could not be
permitted to stay in Egypt. Through the want of friends
and their distrust owing to the desertions, Euphronius, the
instructor of the children, was sent on the embassy. For
Alexas,<a id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_463_463">463</a> of Laodiceia, who at Rome had become known to
Antonius through Timagenes, and possessed most influence
of all the Greeks, who also had been the most active of the
instruments of Cleopatra against Antonius, and had overthrown
all the reflections which rose in his mind about
Octavia, had been sent to King Herodes to keep him from
changing; and having stayed there and betrayed Antonius,
he had the impudence to go into the presence of Cæsar,
relying on Herodes. But Herodes helped him not, but
being forthwith confined and carried in chains to his own
country, he was put to death there by order of Cæsar.
Such was the penalty for his infidelity that Alexas paid to
Antonius in his lifetime.</p>
<p>LXXIII.<a id="j73"></a> Cæsar would not listen to what was said on
behalf of Antonius; but as to Cleopatra, he replied that
she should not fail to obtain anything that was reasonable
if she would kill Antonius or drive him away. He also
sent with the ambassadors of Antonius and Cleopatra one
Thyrsus,<a id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_464_464">464</a> a freedman of his, a man not devoid of judgment,
nor, as coming from a young general, one who would fail in
persuasive address to a haughty woman who was wonderfully
proud of her beauty. This man, having longer interviews
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
with Cleopatra than the rest, and being specially
honoured, caused Antonius to have suspicions, and he
seized and whipped him; and he then sent him back to
Cæsar with a letter to the effect that Thyrsus, by giving
himself airs and by his insolent behaviour, had irritated
him, who was easily irritated by reason of his misfortunes.
“But you,” he said, “if you do not like the thing, have
my freedman Hipparchus. Hang him up and whip him,
that we may be on equal terms.” Upon this Cleopatra,
with the view of doing away with his cause of complaint
and suspicions, paid more than usual court to Antonius:
she kept her own birthday in a mean manner and a way
suitable to her condition, but she celebrated the birthday
of Antonius with an excess of splendour and cost, so that
many of those who were invited to the feast came poor
and went away rich. Agrippa<a id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_465_465">465</a> in the meantime called
Cæsar back, frequently writing to him from Rome, and
urging that affairs there required his presence.</p>
<p>LXXIV.<a id="j74"></a> Accordingly for the time the war was suspended;
but when the winter was over, Cæsar advanced
through Syria and his generals through Libya. Pelusium
was taken, and it was said that Seleukus gave it up, not
without the consent of Cleopatra. But Cleopatra surrendered
to Antonius the wife and children of Seleukus to
be put to death; and as she had a tomb and a monument
constructed of unusual beauty and height, which she had
built close to the temple of Isis, she collected there the
most precious of the royal treasures, gold, silver, emeralds,
pearls, ebony, ivory, and cinnamon, and also a great
quantity of fire-wood and tow; so that Cæsar, being afraid
about the money, lest Cleopatra becoming desperate should
destroy and burn the wealth, kept continually forwarding
to her hopes of friendly treatment while he was advancing
with his army against the city. When Cæsar had taken
his position near the hippodrome, Antonius sallied forth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>and fought gallantly, and he put Cæsar’s cavalry to flight
and pursued them to the camp. Elated with his victory,
he entered the palace and embraced Cleopatra in his
armour, and presented to her one of the soldiers who had
fought most bravely. Cleopatra gave the soldier as a reward
of his courage a golden breastplate and a helmet.
The man took them, and in the night deserted to Cæsar.</p>
<p>LXXV.<a id="j75"></a> Again, Antonius sent to Cæsar and challenged
him to single combat. Cæsar replied that Antonius had
many ways of dying, on which Antonius, reflecting that
there was no better mode of death for him than in battle,
determined to try a land battle and a naval battle at the
same time. And at supper, it is said, he bade the slaves
to pour out and feast him cheerfully, for it was uncertain
whether they would do that on the morrow or would be
serving other masters, while he should lie a corpse and
should be a nothing. Seeing that his friends shed tears at
his words, he said that he would not lead them out to a
battle from which he would seek for himself a glorious
death rather than safety and victory. During this night,
it is said, about the middle thereof, while the city was
quiet and depressed through fear and expectation of the
future, all at once certain harmonious sounds from all
kinds of instruments were heard, and shouts of a crowd
with Evoes<a id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_466_466">466</a> and satyric leapings, as if some company of
revellers not without noise were going out of the city;
and the course of the procession seemed to be through the
middle of the city to the gate leading outwards in the
direction of the enemy, and at this point the tumult made
its way out, being loudest there. And those who reflected
on the sign were of opinion that the god to whom Antonius
all along most likened himself and most claimed
kinship with was deserting him.</p>
<p>LXXVI.<a id="j76"></a><a id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_467_467">467</a> At daybreak Antonius posted his troops on the
hills in front of the city, and watched his ships, which were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>put in motion and advancing against those of the enemy;
and as he expected to see something great done by them,
he remained quiet. But when the men of Antonius came
near, they saluted with their oars Cæsar’s men, and as
they returned the salute, the men of Antonius changed
sides, and the fleet becoming one by the junction of all the
ships, sailed with the vessels’ heads turned against the city.
As soon as Antonius saw this, he was deserted by the
cavalry, who changed sides, and being defeated with his
infantry he retired into the city, crying out that he was
betrayed by Cleopatra to those with whom he was warring
on her account. Cleopatra, fearing his anger and despair,
fled to the tomb and let down the folding doors which were
strengthened with bars and bolts; and she sent persons to
Antonius to inform him that she was dead. Antonius,
believing the intelligence, said to himself, “Why dost thou
still delay, Antonius? fortune has taken away the sole remaining
excuse for clinging to life.” He then entered his
chamber, and loosing his body armour and taking it in
pieces, he said: “Cleopatra, I am not grieved at being deprived
of thee, for I shall soon come to the same place with
thee; but I am grieved that I, such an Imperator, am shown
to be inferior to a woman in courage.” Now Antonius had
a faithful slave named Eros, whom he had long before exhorted,
if the necessity should arise, to kill him; and he
now claimed the performance of the promise. Eros drew
his sword and held it out as if he were going to strike his
master, but he turned away his face and killed himself.
As Eros fell at his master’s feet Antonius said, “Well done,
Eros, though you are not able to do this for me, you teach
me what I ought to do;” and piercing himself through the
belly he threw himself on the bed. But the wound was
not immediately mortal; and accordingly, as the flow of
blood ceased when he lay down, he came to himself and requested
the bystanders to finish him. But they fled from
the chamber while he was calling out and writhing in
pain, till Diomedes the secretary came from Cleopatra
with orders to convey him to her to the tomb.</p>
<p>LXXVII.<a id="j77"></a><a id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_468_468">468</a> When he learned that she was alive, he
eagerly commanded his slaves to take him up, and he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>carried in their arms to the doors of the chamber. Cleopatra
did not open the doors, but she appeared at a window,
from which she let down cords and ropes; and when the
slaves below had fastened Antonius to them, she drew him
up with the aid of the two women whom alone she had
admitted into the tomb with her. Those who were present
say that there never was a more piteous sight; for stained
with blood and struggling with death he was hauled up,
stretching out his hands to her, while he was suspended in
the air. For the labour was not light for women, and
Cleopatra with difficulty, holding with her hands and
straining the muscles of her face, pulled up the rope, while
those who were below encouraged her and shared in her
agony. When she had thus got him in and laid him down,
she rent her garments over him, and beating her breasts
and scratching them with her hands, and wiping the blood
off him with her face, she called him master and husband
and Imperator; and she almost forgot her own misfortunes
through pity for his. Antonius, stopping her
lamentations, asked for wine to drink, whether it was that
he was thirsty or that he expected to be released more
speedily. When he had drunk it, he advised her, if it
could be done with decency, to look after the preservation
of her own interests, and to trust to Procleius<a id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_469_469">469</a> most of the
companions of Cæsar; and not to lament him for his last reverses,
but to think him happy for the good things that he
had obtained, having become the most illustrious of men
and had the greatest power, and now not ignobly a Roman
by a Roman vanquished.</p>
<p>LXXVIII.<a id="j78"></a> Just as Antonius died, Procleius came from
Cæsar;<a id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_470_470">470</a> for after Antonius had wounded himself and was
carried to Cleopatra, Derketæus, one of his guards, taking
his dagger and concealing it, secretly made his way from
the palace, and running to Cæsar, was the first to report
the death of Antonius, and he showed the blood-stained
dagger. When Cæsar heard the news, he retired within
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>his tent and wept for a man who had been related to him
by marriage, and his colleague in command, and his companion
in many struggles and affairs. He then took the
letters that had passed between him and Antonius, and
calling his friends, read them, in order to show in what a
reasonable and fair tone he had written himself, and how
arrogant and insolent Antonius had always been in his
answers. Upon this he sent Procleius with orders, if possible,
above all things to secure Cleopatra alive; for he
was afraid about the money, and he thought it a great
thing for the glory of his triumph to lead her in the procession.
However Cleopatra would not put herself in the
hands of Procleius; but they talked together while he was
standing on the outside close to the building near a door
on a level with the ground, which was firmly secured, but
allowed a passage for the voice. In their conversation
Cleopatra entreated that her children might have the
kingdom, and Procleius bade her be of good cheer and trust
to Cæsar in all things.</p>
<p>LXXIX.<a id="j79"></a> After Procleius had inspected the place and
reported to Cæsar, Gallus<a id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_471_471">471</a> was sent to have another interview
with her; and having come to the door he purposely
prolonged the conversation. In the meantime Procleius
applied a ladder and got through the window by which
the women took in Antonius; and he immediately went
down with two slaves to the door at which Cleopatra
stood with her attention directed to Gallus. One of the
women who were shut up with Cleopatra called out,
“Wretched Cleopatra, you are taken alive,” on which she
turned round, and seeing Procleius, attempted to stab herself,
for she happened to have by her side a dagger such
as robbers wear: but Procleius, quickly running up to
her and holding her with both his hands, said, “You
wrong yourself, Cleopatra, and Cæsar too by attempting
to deprive him of the opportunity of a noble display of
magnanimity and to fix on the mildest of commanders the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>stigma of faithlessness and implacability.” At the same
time he took away her dagger and shook her dress to see
if she concealed any poison. There was also sent from
Cæsar one of his freedmen, Epaphroditus, whose orders
were to watch over her life with great care, but as to the
rest to give way in all things that would make her most
easy and be most agreeable to her.</p>
<p>LXXX.<a id="j80"></a> Cæsar entered the city talking with Areius the
philosopher, and he had given Areius<a id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_472_472">472</a> his right hand, that
he might forthwith be conspicuous among the citizens and
be admired on account of the special respect that he received
from Cæsar. Entering the gymnasium and ascending
a tribunal that was made for him, the people the while
being terror-struck and falling down before him, he bade
them get up, and he said that he acquitted the people of
all blame, first on account of the founder Alexander, second
because he admired the beauty and magnitude of the city,
and third, to please his friend Areius. Such honour Areius
obtained from Cæsar, and he got the pardon of many others;
and among them was Philostratus,<a id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_473_473">473</a> a man of all sophists
the most competent to speak on the sudden, but one who
claimed to be of the Academy without just grounds.
Wherefore Cæsar, who abominated his habits, would not
listen to his entreaties. But Philostratus, letting his white
beard grow and putting on a dark vest, followed behind
Areius, continually uttering this verse:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Wise save the wise, if wise indeed they be.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Cæsar hearing of this, pardoned Philostratus, wishing
rather to release Areius from odium than Philostratus from
fear.</p>
<p>LXXXI.<a id="j81"></a> Of the children of Antonius, Antyllus,<a id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_474_474">474</a> the son
of Fulvia, was given up by his pædagogus Theodorus and
put to death; and when the soldiers had cut off his head,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>the pædagogus took the most precious stone which he wore
about his neck and sewed it in his belt; and though he
denied the fact, he was convicted of it and crucified. The
children of Cleopatra were guarded together with those
who had charge of them, and they had a liberal treatment;
but as to Cæsarion, who was said to be Cleopatra’s son by
Cæsar, her mother sent him to India with much treasure
by way of Ethiopia; but another pædagogus like Theodorus,
named Rhodon, persuaded him to return, saying that
Cæsar invited him to take the kingdom. While Cæsar was
deliberating about Cæsarion, it is said that Areius observed:
“Tis no good thing, a multitude of Cæsars.”<a id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_475_475">475</a></p>
<p>LXXXII.<a id="j82"></a> Now Cæsar put Cæsarion to death after the
death of Cleopatra. Though many asked for the body of
Antonius to bury it, both kings and commanders, Cæsar
did not take it from Cleopatra, but it was interred by her
own hands sumptuously and royally, and she received for
that purpose all that she wished. In consequence of so
much grief and pain, for her breasts were inflamed by the
blows that she had inflicted and were sore, and a fever
coming on, she gladly availed herself of this pretext for
abstaining from food and with the design of releasing
herself from life without hindrance. There was a physician
with whom she was familiar, Olympus, to whom she told
the truth, and she had him for her adviser and assistant in
accomplishing her death, as Olympus said in a history of
these transactions which he published. Cæsar suspecting
her design, plied her with threats and alarms about her
children, by which Cleopatra was thrown down as by
engines of war, and she gave up her body to be treated and
nourished as it was wished.</p>
<p>LXXXIII.<a id="j83"></a> Cæsar himself came a few days after to see
her and pacify her.<a id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_476_476">476</a> Cleopatra happened to be lying on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>mattress meanly dressed, and as he entered she sprang up
in a single vest and fell at his feet with her head and face in
the greatest disorder, her voice trembling and her eyes
weakened by weeping. There were also visible many
marks of the blows inflicted on her breast; and in fine her
body seemed in no respect to be in better plight than her
mind. Yet that charm and that saucy confidence in her
beauty were not completely extinguished, but, though she
was in such a condition, shone forth from within and
showed themselves in the expression of her countenance.
When Cæsar had bid her lie down and had seated himself
near her, she began to touch upon a kind of justification,
and endeavoured to turn all that had happened upon
necessity and fear of Antonius; but as Cæsar on each
point met her with an answer, being confuted, she all at
once changed her manner to move him by pity and by
prayers, as a person would do who clung most closely to
life. Finally she handed to him a list of all the treasures
that she had; and when Seleukus, one of her stewards,
declared that she was hiding and secreting some things,
she sprang up and laying hold of his hair, belaboured him
with many blows on the face. As Cæsar smiled and stopped
her, she said, “But is it not scandalous, Cæsar, that you
have condescended to come to me and speak to me in my
wretched condition, and my slaves make it a matter of
charge against me if I have reserved some female ornaments,
not for myself forsooth, wretch that I am, but that
I may give a few things to Octavia and your wife Livia,
and so through their means make you more favourable to
me and more mild.” Cæsar was pleased with these words,
being fully assured that she wished to live. Accordingly,
after saying that he left these matters to her care and
that in everything else he would behave to her better than
she expected, he went away, thinking that he had deceived
her; but he had deceived himself.</p>
<p>LXXXIV.<a id="j84"></a> Now there was Cornelius Dolabella,<a id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_477_477">477</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
youth of rank, and one of the companions<a id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_478_478">478</a> of Cæsar. He
was not without a certain liking towards Cleopatra; and
now, in order to gratify her request, he secretly sent and
informed her that Cæsar himself was going to march with
his troops through Syria, and that he had determined to
send off her with her children on the third day. On hearing
this, Cleopatra first entreated Cæsar to permit her to
pour libations on the tomb of Antonius; and when Cæsar
permitted it, she went to the tomb, and embracing the coffin
in company with the women who were usually about her,
said, “Dear Antonius, I buried thee recently with hands
still free, but now I pour out libations as a captive and so
watched that I cannot either with blows or sorrow disfigure
this body of mine now made a slave and preserved
to form a part in the triumph over thee. But expect not
other honours or libations, for these are the last which
Cleopatra brings. Living, nothing kept us asunder, but
there is a risk of our changing places in death; thou a
Roman, lying buried here, and I, wretched woman, in Italy,
getting only as much of thy country as will make me a
grave. But if indeed there is any help and power in the
gods there (for the gods of this country have deserted us),
do not deliver thy wife up alive, and let not thyself be
triumphed over in me, but hide me here with thee and bury
thee with me; for though I have ten thousand ills, not one
of them is so great and grievous as this short time which
I have lived apart from thee!”</p>
<p>LXXXV.<a id="j85"></a> After making this lamentation and crowning
and embracing the coffin, she ordered a bath to be prepared
for her. After bathing, she lay down and enjoyed
a splendid banquet. And there came one from the country
bringing a basket; and on the guards asking what he
brought, the man opened it, and taking off the leaves
showed the vessel full of figs. The soldiers admiring
their beauty and size, the man smiled and told them to
take some, whereon, without having any suspicion, they
bade him carry them in. After feasting, Cleopatra took
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>a tablet, which was already written, and sent it sealed to
Cæsar, and, causing all the rest of her attendants to withdraw
except those two women, she closed the door. As
soon as Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_479_479">479</a> opened the tablet and found in it the prayers
and lamentations of Cleopatra, who begged him to bury her
with Antonius, he saw what had taken place. At first he
was for setting out himself to give help, but the next thing
that he did was to send persons with all speed to inquire.
But the tragedy had been speedy; for, though they ran
thither and found the guards quite ignorant of everything,
as soon as they opened the door they saw Cleopatra lying
dead on a golden couch in royal attire. Of her two women,
Eiras was dying at her feet, and Charmion, already staggering
and drooping her head, was arranging the diadem on
the forehead of Cleopatra. One of them saying in passion,
“A good deed this, Charmion;” “Yes, most goodly,” she
replied, “and befitting the descendant of so many kings.”
She spake not another word, but fell there by the side of
the couch.</p>
<p>LXXXVI.<a id="j86"></a> Now it is said that the asp was brought with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>those figs and leaves, and was covered with them; for that
Cleopatra had so ordered, that the reptile might fasten on
her body without her being aware of it. But when she
had taken up some of the figs and saw it, she said, “Here
then it is,” and baring her arm, she offered it to the serpent
to bite. Others say that the asp was kept in a water-pitcher,
and that Cleopatra drew it out with a golden distaff
and irritated it till the reptile sprang upon her arm
and clung to it. But the real truth nobody knows; for it
was also said that she carried poison about her in a hollow
comb, which she concealed in her hair; however, no spots
broke out on her body, nor any other sign of poison. Nor
yet was the reptile seen within the palace; but some said
that they observed certain marks of its trail near the sea,
in that part towards which the chamber looked and the
windows were. Some also say that the arm of Cleopatra
was observed to have two small indistinct punctures; and
it seems that Cæsar believed this, for in the triumph a
figure of Cleopatra was carried with the asp clinging to
her. Such is the way in which these events are told.
Though Cæsar was vexed at the death of Cleopatra, he
admired her nobleness of mind, and he ordered the body
to be interred with that of Antonius in splendid and royal
style. The women of Cleopatra also received honourable
interment by his orders. Cleopatra at the time of her
death was forty years of age save one, and she had reigned
as queen two-and-twenty years, and governed together
with Antonius more than fourteen. Antonius, according
to some, was six years, according to others, three years
above fifty. Now the statues of Antonius were thrown
down, but those of Cleopatra remained standing, for
Archibius, one of her friends, gave Cæsar two thousand
talents that they might not share the same fate as those
of Antonius.</p>
<p>LXXXVII.<a id="j87"></a> Antonius by his three wives left seven
children, of whom Antyllus, the eldest, was the only one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]<br>[Pg 347]</a></span>
who was put to death by Cæsar; the rest Octavia<a id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_480_480">480</a> took
and brought them up with her own children. Cleopatra,
the daughter of Cleopatra, she married to Juba, the most
accomplished of kings; and Antonius, the son of Fulvia,
she raised so high that, while Agrippa held the first place
in Cæsar’s estimation, and the sons of Livia the second,
Antonius had and was considered to have the third. Octavia
had by Marcellus two daughters, and one son,
Marcellus, whom Cæsar made both his son and son-in-law,
and he gave one of the daughters to Agrippa. But as
Marcellus died very soon after his marriage, and it was
not easy for Cæsar to choose from the rest of his friends a
son-in-law whom he could trust, Octavia proposed to him
that Agrippa should take Cæsar’s daughter and put away
her daughter. Cæsar was first persuaded and then Agrippa,
whereupon Octavia took her own daughter back and
married her to Antonius; and Agrippa married Cæsar’s
daughter. There were two daughters of Antonius and
Octavia, of whom Domitius Ænobarbus took one to wife;
and the other, who was famed for her virtues and her
beauty, Antonia, was married to Drusus, the son of Livia,
and step-son of Cæsar. From the marriage of Drusus and
Antonia came Germanicus and Claudius, of whom Claudius
afterwards ruled; and of the children of Germanicus, Caius,
who ruled with distinction for no long time, was destroyed
together with his child and wife; and Agrippina, who had
by Ænobarbus a son, Lucius Domitius, married Claudius
Cæsar; and Claudius adopting her son, named him Nero
Germanicus. Nero, who ruled in my time, slew his
mother, and through his violence and madness came very
near subverting the supremacy of Rome, being the fifth
from Antonius in the order of succession.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>
<h2>COMPARISON OF DEMETRIUS AND
ANTONIUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="k1"></a> Since, then, great changes of fortune took place in each
of their lives, let us first consider their power and renown.
The position of Demetrius was inherited and already made
for him, as Antigonus was the most powerful of the
successors of Alexander, and, before Demetrius came of
age, had overrun and conquered the greater part of Asia:
while Antonius, whose father, though an excellent man,
was no soldier, and left him no renown, yet dared to seize
upon the empire of Cæsar, with which he was in no way
connected, and constituted himself the heir of what Cæsar
had won by the sword. Starting as a mere private person,
he raised himself to such a height of power as to be able
to divide the world into two, and to select and obtain the
fairer half for his own, while, without his being even
present, his lieutenants and agents inflicted several defeats
upon the Parthians, and conquered all the nations of Asia
as far as the Caspian Sea. Even that for which he is
especially reproached proves the greatness of his power.
Demetrius’s father was well pleased at getting Phila, the
daughter of Antipater, as a wife for his son, in spite of the
disparity of their ages, because he regarded her as his
son’s superior; while it was thought to be a disgrace for
Antonius to ally himself with Cleopatra, a woman who
excelled in power and renown all the Kings of her age,
except Arsakes himself. Antonius had made himself so
great that men thought him entitled to more even than
he himself desired.</p>
<p>II.<a id="k2"></a> Demetrius, however, cannot be blamed for attempting
to make himself king over a people accustomed to
servitude, while it appeared harsh and tyrannical for
Antonius to try to enslave the people of Rome just <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>after
they had been set free from the rule of Cæsar: and the
greatest of his exploits, the war against Brutus and Cassius,
was waged with the intention of depriving his countrymen
of their liberty. Demetrius, before he became involved in
difficulties, used always to act as a liberator towards Greece,
and to drive out the foreign garrisons from her cities, and
did not act like Antonius, who boasted that he had slain
the would-be liberators of Rome in Macedonia. And
though Antonius is especially commended for his magnificent
generosity, yet Demetrius so far surpassed him as
to bestow more upon his enemies than Antonius would
upon his friends. It is true that Antonius gained great
credit for having caused Brutus to be honourably buried;
but Demetrius buried all his enemy’s slain, gave money
and presents to his prisoners, and sent them back to
Ptolemy.</p>
<p>III.<a id="k3"></a> Both were arrogant when in prosperity, and set no
bounds to their luxury and pleasures. Yet it cannot be
said that Demetrius was ever so immersed in enjoyments
as to let slip the time for action, but he only dedicated
the superfluity of his leisure to enjoyment, and used his
Lamia, like the mythical nightmare, only when he was
half asleep or at play. When he was preparing for war,
no ivy wreathed his spear, no perfume scented his helmet,
nor did he go forth from his bed-chamber to battle covered
with finery, but, as Euripides says, he laid the Bacchic
wand aside, and served the unhallowed god of war, and,
indeed, never suffered any reverse through his own carelessness
or love of pleasure. But just as in pictures we
often see Omphale stealing the club and stripping off the
lion’s skin from Herakles, so Cleopatra frequently would
disarm Antonius and turn his mind to pleasure, persuading
him to give up mighty enterprises and even necessary
campaigns to wander and sport with her on the shores of
Canopus and beside the tomb of Osiris. At last, like Paris,
he fled from battle to nestle on her breast, though Paris
only took refuge in his chamber after he had been defeated
in battle, while Antonius, by his pursuit of Cleopatra,
gave up his chance of victory.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="k4"></a> Moreover, in marrying several wives, Demetrius
did not break through any custom, for he only did <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>what
had been usual for the kings of Macedonia since the days
of Philip and Alexander, and what was done by
Lysimachus and Ptolemy in his own time; and he showed
due respect to all his wives; while Antonius, in the first
place, married two wives at the same time, which no
Roman had ever dared to do before, and then drove away
his own countrywoman and his legitimate wife to please
a foreigner, and one to whom he was not legally
married. Yet with all his excesses Antonius was never
led by his vices into such sacrilegious impiety as is recorded
of Demetrius. We are told that no dogs are allowed
to enter the Acropolis,<a id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_481_481">481</a> because these animals copulate more
openly than any others; but Demetrius consorted with
harlots in the very temple of the virgin goddess, and
debauched many of the Athenian citizens, while, although
one would have imagined that a man of such a temperament
would be especially averse to cruelty, Demetrius must be
charged with this in allowing, or rather compelling, the
most beautiful and modest of the Athenians to suffer death
in order to avoid outrage. To sum up, the vices of Antonius
were ruinous to himself, while those of Demetrius
were ruinous to others.</p>
<p>V.<a id="k5"></a> Yet Demetrius always behaved well to his parents,
whereas Antonius allowed his mother’s brother to perish
in order that he might compass the death of Cicero, which
was of itself so odious a crime that we should scarcely
think Antonius justified if by Cicero’s death he had saved
his uncle’s life. With regard to the perjuries and breaking
of their words which they both committed, the one in
seizing Artabazus, and the other in murdering Alexander,
Antonius has a satisfactory defence; for he himself was
first deserted and betrayed by Artabazus in Media: while
many writers say that Demetrius himself invented false
pretexts for his treatment of Alexander, and accused a
man whom he had wronged with a design on his life,
instead of defending himself against one who was already
his enemy. Again, the exploits of Demetrius were all
accomplished by himself in person; while, on the other
hand, Antonius won some of his most important battles by
his lieutenants, without himself being present.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>
<p>VI.<a id="k6"></a> The ruin of both was due to themselves, though in
a different manner, for the Macedonians deserted from
Demetrius, while Antonious deserted his own troops when
they were risking their lives in his defence; so that we must
blame the former for having rendered his army so hostile
to him, and the latter for betraying so much loyalty and
devotion. In their manner of death neither can be praised,
but that of Demetrius seems the less creditable of the two,
for he endured to be taken prisoner, and when in confinement
willingly spent three years in drinking and gluttony,
like a wild beast that has been tamed; while Antonius,
though he killed himself like a coward, and in a piteous
and dishonourable fashion, nevertheless died before he fell
into the hands of his enemy.</p>

<h2>LIFE OF DION.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="l1"></a> We are told by the poet Simonides, Sossius Senecio, that
the Trojans bore no malice against the Corinthians for
joining the rest of the Greeks in the siege of Troy, because
Glaukus, who was himself of Corinthian extraction, fought
heartily on their side. In the same manner we may
expect that neither Greeks nor Romans will be able to
blame the doctrines of the academy, as each nation derives
equal credit from their practice in this book of mine, which
contains the lives of Brutus and Dion, of whom the latter
was Plato’s intimate friend, while the former was educated
by his writings: so that they were both, as it were, sent
forth from the same school to contend for the greatest prizes.
It is not surprising, therefore, that there should be a great
similarity between their respective achievements, or that
they should have proved the truth of that maxim of their
teacher, that nothing great or noble can be effected in
politics except when a wise and just man is possessed
of absolute power combined with good fortune. Just as
Hippomachus the gymnastic trainer used to declare that
he could always tell by their carriage those who had been
his pupils, even though he only saw them from a distance
when they were carrying meat home for their dinner, so
we may imagine that philosophy accompanies those who
have been brought up in its precepts in every action of
their lives, adding a happy grace and fitness to all that
they do.</p>
<p>II.<a id="l2"></a> Their lives resemble one another even more in their
misfortunes than in the objects at which they aimed. Both
of them perished by an untimely fate, unable, with all
their mighty efforts, to accomplish the object which they
had in view. The most remarkable point of all is <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>that
they both received a supernatural warning of their death by
the appearance to them of an evil spirit in a dream. Yet
it is a common argument with those who deny the truth
of such matters that no man of sense ever could see a
ghost or spirit but that it is only children and women
and men who are wandering in their mind through sickness,
who through disorder of the brain or distemperature
of the body are subject to these vain and ominous fancies,
which really arise from the evil spirit of superstition
within themselves. If, however, Dion and Brutus, both
of whom were serious and philosophic men, not at all liable
to be mistaken or easy to be deceived about such matters,
did really experience a supernatural visitation so distinctly
that they told other persons about it, I do not know
whether we may not be obliged to adopt that strangest of
all the theories of the ancients that evil and malignant
spirits feel a spite against good men, and try to oppose
their actions, throwing confusion and terror in their way
in order to shake them in their allegiance to virtue;
because they fear lest if they passed their lives entirely
pure and without spot of sin, they might after death
obtain a higher place than themselves. This, however, I
must reserve for discussion in another place; and now, in
this my twelfth book of parallel lives, I will first proceed
to deal with the elder man of the two.</p>
<p>III.<a id="l3"></a> Dionysius the elder, as soon as he had raised
himself to the throne, married the daughter of Hermokrates
of Syracuse. However, as his power was not yet
firmly established, the people of Syracuse rose in revolt,
and committed such shocking outrages upon the person of
Dionysius’s wife, that she voluntarily put herself to death.
Dionysius, after recovering and confirming his power, now
married two wives at the same time, one of whom was a
Lokrian, named Doris, and the other a native of Syracuse,
named Aristomache, the daughter of Hipparinus, one of
the first men in Syracuse, who had acted as colleague
with Dionysius himself when he was appointed to the
command of the army with unlimited powers. It is said
that he married them both upon the same day, and that
no man knew which he visited first; and of the remainder
of his life he spent an equal share of his time with each,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
as he always supped in company with both of them, and
spent the night with each in turn. The populace of
Syracuse would fain have hoped that their countrywoman
would be preferred to the stranger; but it was the
stranger who first bore a son and heir to Dionysius, to
counterbalance her foreign parentage; while Aristomache
remained childless for a long time, although Dionysius
was anxious to have a family by her, and even put to
death the mother of his Lokrian wife on a charge of
having bewitched her.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="l4"></a> Dion was the brother of Aristomache, and at first
was treated with respect for the sake of his sister, but
afterwards, when he had given proofs of his ability, he
gained the favour of the despot by his own good qualities.
Besides many other privileges, Dionysius ordered his
treasurers to give Dion anything that he might ask for,
letting him know on the same day what they had given
him. He was naturally of a high minded and manly
disposition, and he was greatly encouraged in the path of
virtue by the providential accident of Plato’s visit to
Sicily. This never could have been calculated upon
according to human ideas of probability; but it seems as
though some divinity, who had long been meditating how
to put liberty within the reach of the Syracusans and to
free them from despotism, must have brought Plato from
Italy to Syracuse, and caused Dion to become his disciple.
Dion at this time was very young, but was by far the most
apt of Plato’s scholars, and the readiest to follow out his
master’s instructions in virtue. This we learn from
Plato’s own account of him, and from the circumstances
of the case. Brought up as Dion had been in the humble
position of a subject under a despotic ruler, his life had
been full of sudden alarms and violent alternations of
fortune; yet, though he was at this time accustomed to
live in a state of parvenu splendour, and to regard
pleasure and power as the only objects of desire, he, as
soon as he had become acquainted with philosophic reasoning
and exhortation to virtue, became passionately interested
in it. With the guileless innocence of youth he
imagined that the discourses which he had heard would
produce an equally deep impression upon the mind <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>of
Dionysius, and took considerable pains to bring Dionysius
to meet Plato and listen to his arguments.</p>
<p>V.<a id="l5"></a> When the meeting took place, Plato chose for his
subject human virtue, and discussed more particularly the
virtue of manly courage, proving that despots are the
most cowardly of men. From this he went on to speak
of justice, and as he pointed out that the life of the just
is happy, and that of the unjust miserable, Dionysius,
who considered the lecture as a reproach to himself,
was much exasperated, especially when he observed
how all the audience admired Plato and were enchanted
by his rhetoric. At last in a rage he asked him
why he had come to Sicily: and when Plato answered that
he had come in order to find a good man, Dionysius caught
up his words, and said, “You seem hitherto not to have
found one.”</p>
<p>Dion and his friends imagined that this outburst marked
the end of Dionysius’s indignation; and as Plato was now
anxious to leave Sicily they obtained a passage for him on
board of a trireme which was about to convey home Pollis,
the Lacedæmonian envoy. Dionysius however secretly
besought Pollis to put Plato to death during the voyage, or
at any rate to sell him for a slave, because, he said, Plato,
according to his own showing, would be none the worse
off for being a slave, but would be just as happy, provided
that he was just. In consequence of this we are told that
Pollis took Plato to Ægina and there sold him, because
the people of Ægina were at that time at war with the
Athenians, and had passed a decree that any Athenian
found in Ægina should be sold for a slave.<a id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_482_482">482</a> Yet Dion
was no less honoured and trusted by Dionysius in consequence
of this, but was entrusted with the management
of the most important negotiations, and was himself sent
as ambassador to Carthage, in which capacity he gained
great credit. Indeed he was almost the only person whom
Dionysius allowed freely to speak his mind, as is proved
by the reproof which he gave Dionysius about Gelon. It
appears that Dionysius was sneering at Gelon and his
kingdom, and saying that he was the laughing-stock of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>Sicily. All the other courtiers pretended to approve of
this jest, but Dion harshly answered, “Yet you have been
allowed to become our despot because of the good example
set by Gelon; but your example will not encourage any
state to imitate us.” In truth Gelon’s conduct as an
absolute monarch seems to have been just as admirable as
that of Dionysius was detestable.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="l6"></a> Dionysius had three children by his Lokrian wife,
and four by Aristomache. Of his two daughters,
Sophrosyne married her half-brother, and Arete married
Thearides, the brother of Dionysius, but on the death of
Thearides Dion took Arete, who was his own niece, for his
wife. In Dionysius’s last illness, when his life was
despaired of, Dion wished to ask him what was to become
of the children of Aristomache, but the physicians, who
wished to pay their court to the heir to the throne, would
not allow Dion an opportunity of doing so. Timæus even
states that when Dionysius asked for a sleeping draught
they gave him one which rendered him completely insensible,
so that he passed from sleep into death.
However, as soon as the young Dionysius assembled his
friends in council, Dion made such an admirable speech
upon the political situation that all the others appeared by
his side to be mere children in intellect, and their words
seemed to be those of slaves and grovelling flatterers of
the despot when compared with his bold and fearless
utterances. He impressed upon their minds the greatness
of the danger by which they were menaced by Carthage,
and promised that if Dionysius wished for peace he
himself would at once set sail for Africa and obtain the
best terms he could; or that, if he preferred to fight,
he would place at his disposal a force of fifty triremes,
which he would maintain at his own expense.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="l7"></a> Dionysius greatly admired his magnanimity and
approved of his zeal; but the others, who thought that
they were eclipsed by Dion, and were jealous of his power,
at once set to work to effect his ruin, and lost no opportunity
of exasperating the young despot against him by pointing
out that he was plotting to obtain the supreme throne by
means of the fleet, and that his object in making the offer
of the ships was to place all real power in the hands <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>of
the children of Aristomache. Their hate and jealousy of
Dion was chiefly owing to the proud reserve of his life, so
different to their own: for they at once began to court the
friendship of their young and ill-trained monarch by
offering him all kinds of flatteries and pleasures, endeavouring
to amuse his leisure by vagrant amours, drinking
parties, and the like dissolute pastimes, which blunted the
excessive sharpness of his tyranny, and made his subjects
regard it as milder and less ferocious than before, although
the alteration was due only to the laziness and not to the
real goodness of their ruler. By slow degrees the extravagance
and licentious life of the young monarch relaxed
and broke those “chains of adamant” by which the elder
Dionysius boasted that he had secured his power. We are
told that he once continued drinking for ninety days in
succession, and that during the whole of this time his court
was a place which no respectable person could enter, and
where no business could be transacted, as it was a constant
scene of singing, jesting, dancing, drunkenness and
debauchery.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="l8"></a> As may easily be imagined, Dion soon lost the
favour of the monarch, as he never relaxed the austerity
of his life. For this reason the calumnies of infamous
men were more easily believed by Dionysius, when they
attacked the virtues of Dion, calling his pride arrogance,
and his boldness of speech churlishness. When he gave
good advice he was thought to reproach them, and because
he refused to join in their excesses, he seemed to despise
them. Indeed, his disposition was naturally inclined to
haughtiness, and his manners harsh and forbidding. It
was not only to a young man whose ears were accustomed
to flatteries that he appeared so ungracious and harsh-tempered,
but even those who were sincerely attached to
him, and who admired the noble simplicity of his character,
used to blame his discourtesy and rudeness towards those
with whom he was brought in contact upon political business.
Indeed, not long after this, Plato, as if prophetically,
wrote to him, warning him against a stubborn and arrogant
temper, the consort of a lonely life. Yet, even at
that time, though Dion was regarded as the most able
man in the state, and was thought to be the only <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>person
who could save the kingdom from the dangers by which
it was menaced, he knew well that his honourable and
powerful position was not due to any love which the
monarch bore him, but merely to the fact that he could
not do without him.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="l9"></a> As Dion imagined that this must be caused by
Dionysius’s want of education, he endeavoured to interest
him in literature, and to form his character by the study
of philosophy and science. Indeed Dionysius was far from
being a stupid ruler, but his father, fearing that if he were
educated, and frequented the society of intellectual men,
he would certainly plot against him and seize his throne,
used to keep him shut up at home, where, through want
of companionship and ignorance, he was forced, we are
told, to amuse himself by making little waggons and
lamps, and wooden chairs and tables; for the elder Dionysius
was so distrustful and suspicious of all men, and
was driven by his fears to take such precautions against
assassination, that he would not even allow his hair to be
cut with a barber’s tools, but a workman used to come and
singe his hair with a live coal. Neither his brother nor
his son was allowed to enter his house in their ordinary
dress, but were obliged to take off their clothes and put
on others, so that they might be seen naked by the guard.
Once when his brother Leptines, describing the situation of
some place, took a spear from one of the life-guards and with
it drew a map upon the floor, Dionysius was furiously angry
with him, and put to death the man who gave him the spear.
He used to say that he suspected all his friends, because
he knew that they were sensible men, who would prefer to
be despots themselves rather than live under the rule of a
despot. He put to death one Marsyas, whom he had himself
promoted to a responsible post, because he dreamed that
he was killing him; for Dionysius argued that his dream
must have been suggested by some thoughts or talk in his
waking hours. To such a condition of terror and
misery was he reduced by his cowardice, although he was
angry with Plato for not declaring him to be the bravest
of men.</p>
<p>X.<a id="l10"></a> Dion, perceiving, as has been said before, that the
character of the young Dionysius had been ruined by <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>his
want of education, begged him to educate himself, to offer
all possible inducements to the first of philosophers to
visit Sicily, and when he came, to place himself in his
hands, in order that his character might be exalted by
the contemplation of virtue, and formed upon the noblest
of models, which alone can produce order out of chaos;
by which means he would not only gain great happiness
for himself, but would bestow great happiness upon the
citizens by his mild and just paternal rule, thus becoming
a true king instead of a despot. He pointed out that the
“adamantine chains” by which Dionysius’s father boasted
that his dominion was secured, were not terror and force,
the numbers of his ships of war, or the thousands of his
barbarian mercenaries, but rather the goodwill, loyalty,
and gratitude engendered by virtue and justice, which,
though softer than those rough defences, would nevertheless
establish his rule far more securely than they.
Besides these considerations he urged that it was a
sorry thing, and showed a want of proper ambition
for a ruler to be splendidly dressed and luxuriously lodged,
but yet to be no more intellectual in his conversation
and arguments than any ordinary man, and to
neglect to adorn the palace of his soul as became a king.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="l11"></a> As Dion frequently urged these considerations, and
quoted several of Plato’s discourses, Dionysius became
passionately desirous of seeing and conversing with
Plato. Many letters were at once sent to Athens by
Dionysius, while Plato also received many injunctions
from Dion and from several of the Pythagorean philosophers
in Italy, bidding him go to Syracuse, undertake
the guidance of the mind of this young and powerful
ruler, and fill it with serious thoughts. Plato obeyed
their invitation, chiefly, he tells us, because he feared to
appear a mere man of words, unwilling to take in hand
any real work, and also because he hoped that if he could
purify the mind of the chief, he might through him
influence for good the whole of the corrupt people of
Sicily. The opponents of Dion, who feared the results
of any change in the character of Dionysius, prevailed
upon him to recall from exile Philistus, a man of intellectual
culture and an experienced courtier, in order <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>to
make use of him as a counterpoise to Plato and his
philosophy. Indeed, Philistus had zealously assisted in
the establishment of the despotism, and for a long time
had acted as chief of the garrison of the citadel. There
was also a report that he had been the favoured lover of
the mother of the elder Dionysius, and that, too, not altogether
without the knowledge of the despot; for when
Leptines, without telling Dionysius of it, gave Philistus
for his wife one of the two daughters which had been
born to him by a woman whom he had seduced while she
was married to another man, and who afterwards lived
with him, Dionysius was very angry, caused the wife of
Leptines to be imprisoned in chains, and forced Philistus
to leave Sicily and take refuge with some friends of his
at Adria, where he is thought to have found leisure to
write the greater part of his history; for he never returned
to Syracuse during the life of the elder Dionysius,
but it was after that prince’s death, as has been told, that
the opposition to Dion brought him back as being a person
more likely to agree with their views and more likely to
support the monarchy.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="l12"></a> Philistus on his return at once became closely
connected with the monarchy; while Dion was assailed
by misrepresentations and slanders reported by others to
the despot, charging him with having discussed the
extinction of despotism with Theodotes and Herakleides.
Dion appears to have hoped by the influence of Plato to
remove from Dionysius all the arbitrary harshness of a
despot, and to make him into an orderly constitutional
ruler. If he resisted, and refused to be thus softened and
refined, Dion had determined to set him aside, and to
restore to the Syracusans their free constitution; not that
he was an admirer of democracy, but because he thought
that at any rate it was better than a despotism for
states which were not ruled by a wise and stable
oligarchy.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="l13"></a> While affairs were in this posture, Plato arrived
at Sicily and received a most kindly and magnificent
welcome. One of the royal carriages, splendidly equipped,
stood ready to receive him as he landed, and Dionysius
offered sacrifice, as though some great good fortune <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>had
befallen his rule. The sobriety of the royal banquets, the
refined tone of the court and the gentle manners of Dionysius
himself in transacting business, all inspired the
Syracusans with great hope of a change for the better.
It became the fashion to take interest in philosophical
matters, and it is said that so many began to study geometry
that the palace was filled with the dust in which
they drew their figures. In a few days’ time a hereditary
sacrifice was celebrated in the palace; and when the
herald, according to custom, prayed that the despotism
might remain unshaken for many years, it is said that
Dionysius, who stood near him, exclaimed: “Will you not
cease from imprecating curses upon us?” This greatly
grieved the party of Philistus, who feared that Plato’s
power over Dionysius would become unassailable, if he
were allowed time to become intimate with him, if after
so short an acquaintance he had already wrought so great
a change in the young man’s ideas.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="l14"></a> They now no longer singly and in secret, but in
a body openly assailed Dion, declaring that they could
easily see through his motives in bewitching Dionysius
with the eloquence of Plato, in order that Dionysius
might be induced to voluntarily abdicate his throne, and
hand it over to the children of Aristomache, whose uncle
Dion was. Some of them even pretended to be angry that,
though in former times a great Athenian naval and
military force sailed thither and perished before it could
effect the conquest of Syracuse, yet now the Athenians
should be able, by means of one single sophist, to
destroy the throne of Dionysius, and persuade him to
desert his ten thousand life-guards, leave his four hundred
ships of war, his ten thousand cavalry and many thousands
more of infantry soldiers, in order to seek in the
Academy for the ineffable good, and find real pleasure in
geometry, leaving the pleasures of power, wealth and
luxury to be enjoyed by Dion and Dion’s nephews. This
led at first to Dion’s being regarded with suspicion, and
then, when Dionysius began to show his dislike openly,
he received a letter which Dion had secretly despatched
to the Carthaginian commanders, warning them, when
they came to treat for peace with Dionysius, not to conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the interview without his being present, as he would
see that the whole matter was permanently settled. We
are told by Timaeus that Dionysius, after reading this
letter to Philistus and having taken counsel with him,
deceived Dion by making false offers of reconciliation
with him. After much friendly talk, he declared that
their differences were at an end, and then, leading him
alone towards the sea-shore under the walls of the citadel,
showed him the letter, and upbraided him with plotting
with the Carthaginians against himself. He would not
listen to Dion when he tried to excuse himself, but at
once placed him on board of a small vessel and ordered the
sailors to land him on the coast of Italy.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="l15"></a> Upon this, as Dionysius appeared to have acted
very harshly, the whole palace was plunged in grief by
the women, while the city of Syracuse became much excited,
expecting that the exile of Dion and the mistrust
with which others regarded the despot would soon lead to
some revolution. Dionysius, perceiving and fearing this,
encouraged the women and friends of Dion, speaking of
Dion as though he were not banished, but had left the
country of his own free will, for fear that if he remained
at home his quick temper might betray him into some
violent collision with himself. He placed two ships at
the disposal of Dion’s relatives, and bade them embark
with as much of his property and servants as they pleased
and go to rejoin him in Peloponnesus. Dion’s property was
very extensive, and his whole household was on a magnificent,
almost a royal, scale. Everything was now
carried away by his friends, and much more was sent to
him by his female relatives and his friends, so that his
wealth and magnificence became famous throughout
Greece, and the power of the despot became enhanced by
the sight of the riches of the exile.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="l16"></a> Dionysius at once removed Plato into the citadel,
where, under pretence of showing him kindly respect, he
was kept in an honourable captivity, in order that he
might not sail away with Dion, a witness of his unjust
treatment. By degrees, like a wild animal who gradually
becomes used to the touch of human beings, so Dionysius
accustomed himself to the society and discourses of Plato,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
and, after the manner of despots, conceived a violent
passion for him. He was especially anxious that Plato
should return his affection and should approve of his acts,
and was even willing to entrust the government and the
crown itself to him if he would only not prefer Dion’s
friendship to his own. This passion of his caused great
annoyance to Plato, for like all true lovers he was furiously
jealous and had frequent quarrels and reconciliations with
him, being very eager to hear his discourses, and engage
in the study of philosophy, and yet being influenced by
those who advised him to keep away from Plato, as he
would be corrupted by his teaching. Meanwhile, as some
war broke out, he sent Plato away, promising that in a
year’s time he would recall Dion. This promise he broke
at once, but he remitted to Dion the revenues of his estate,
and besought Plato to pardon his breach of faith about
the time, because of the war; for, as soon as peace should
be made, he promised that he would at once send for Dion.
He also asked Plato to beg Dion to remain quiet, and not to
engage in any revolutionary schemes, and not to traduce
his character to the Greeks.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="l17"></a> Plato endeavoured to effect this, and turned
Dion’s attention to philosophy, and kept him in the
Academy. Dion lived at this time in the city of Athens,
in the house of Kallippus, one of his friends, though he
also bought an estate in the country for recreation, which,
when he subsequently set sail for Sicily, he presented
to Speusippus, who, of all the Athenians, was his most
intimate friend. This intimacy was brought about by
Plato, who hoped that the harshness of Dion’s character
might be somewhat softened by the society of a well-bred
and cheerful man. Such a person as this was Speusippus,
whom we find spoken of in Timon’s Silli as being
“good at a jest.” When Plato himself exhibited a chorus
of boys, Dion both trained the chorus and defrayed all the
expenses, and Plato permitted him to gain this distinction
although it was likely to obtain popularity for Dion at his
own expense. Dion also visited other cities, where he associated
with the best and most statesmanlike of the citizens,
and attended their solemn festivals, without ever betraying
anything repulsive, affected, or imperious in his manner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
but acting with manliness and discretion, and discoursing
with elegance on philosophy as well as ordinary topics.
By this conduct he everywhere gained good opinions, and
public honours were decreed to him by various cities,
The Lacedæmonians even adopted him as a Spartan, disregarding
the anger of Dionysius, though he at the time
was zealously assisting them in a war against the
Thebans. We are told that once Dion wished to see
Ptoiodorus, of Megara, and went to his house. Ptoiodorus,
it seems, was a rich and powerful man; and when Dion
observed the crowds at his door and the busy throng and
saw how hard it was to gain an audience of him, he
turned to his friends, who were vexed at this, and said:
“Why should we find fault with this man? for we ourselves
used to do just the same thing at Syracuse?”</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="l18"></a> As time went on, Dionysius, feeling jealous of
Dion, and fearing the popularity which he was obtaining
among the Greeks, left off forwarding his revenues to him
and confiscated his property. Being desirous of effacing
the bad impression which he had made upon all philosophers
by his treatment of Plato, he collected round him
many men who had a reputation for learning. As he
wished to surpass them all in argument, he was forced to
make use, often improperly, of what he had very imperfectly
learned from Plato. He now again began to wish
for Plato, and blamed himself for not having made use of
him when he was present, and for not having listened to
all his noble language. Frantic in his desires, and impatient
to obtain whatever he wished, as despots are, he
at once set his heart upon Plato and tried every means to
attract him. He induced Archytas and the other successors
of the original Pythagorean philosophers to invite
Plato; for it was by means of Plato that Dionysius had
at first become their friend. They sent Archedemus to
Plato, and Dionysius also despatched a trireme and
several of his friends to entreat Plato to come: while he
himself wrote a letter in which he distinctly stated that
Dion would never get his rights if Plato refused to come
to Sicily, but that if he would, Dion should receive them
all. Many letters also reached Dion from his sister and
his wife, urging him to beg Plato to accede to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>request
of Dionysius, and not afford him grounds for ill-treating
them. Thus, they say, it was that Plato came to sail a
third time into the straits of Scylla.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Again the dread Charybdis to explore.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XIX.<a id="l19"></a> His arrival afforded unbounded delight to Dionysius,
and again filled Sicily with great hopes; for all men
prayed and were eager that Plato and philosophy should
get the better of Philistus and despotism. He was treated
with great respect by the ladies,<a id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_483_483">483</a> and received from
Dionysius a mark of confidence which was accorded to no
one else, in being allowed to come into his presence
without his clothes being searched. As Dionysius frequently
offered valuable presents to Plato, who never
would receive them, Aristippus of Cyrene, who was present,
observed that Dionysius exercised a very cheap
generosity; for he gave small presents to himself and
to others who wished for more, and offered great ones to
Plato, who would not accept of any. When, however,
after the first welcome was over, Plato began to speak of
Dion, Dionysius at first put off discussing the subject, and
subsequently reproaches and quarrels took place between
them, of which no one else was aware, since Dionysius
kept them secret, and by showing Plato assiduous attentions
and marks of respect tried to win him over from his
friendship for Dion. Plato, too, at first would not publish
what he knew of the treachery and falsehood of Dionysius,
but affected not to perceive it and endured it in silence.
While they were on these terms, though they believed
that no one knew it, Helikon of Kyzikus, an intimate
friend of Plato, foretold an eclipse of the sun; and as it
happened according to his prediction, the despot was much
impressed, and gave him a talent of silver. Aristippus
now in joke said to the other philosophers that he too had
a remarkable event to predict; and when they begged
him to tell them what it was, he said, “I predict that
before long Plato and Dionysius will become foes.” At
last Dionysius sold Dion’s property and kept the money,
and even removed Plato from the lodgings in the gardens
near his own palace, where he had hitherto dwelt, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>quartered him among the mercenary troops, who had long
disliked Plato and wished to make away with him, because
they believed him to be counselling Dionysius to abdicate
and to live without a body-guard.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="l20"></a> Archytas and his friends, when they heard
of the danger to which Plato was exposed, at once sent a
thirty-oared vessel with an embassy to Dionysius, demanding
Plato from him, and alleging that he had originally
come to Syracuse at their request, and that they were responsible
for his safety. Dionysius concealed his dislike
of Plato by feasting him and treating him kindly on his
departure, but could not help saying to him, “I suppose,
Plato, you will abuse me terribly to your fellow-philosophers,”
or something to that effect. At this Plato smiled,
and replied, “I trust that we shall never be so ill off in
the Academy for subjects to discuss, as for any one to
make mention of you.” Such, they say, were the terms
upon which they parted; though this does not entirely
agree with Plato’s own account of the matter.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="l21"></a> Dion was much angered by these proceedings of
Dionysius, and shortly afterwards was converted into an
open enemy on hearing of the treatment of his wife, on
which subject Plato wrote in enigmas to Dionysius. This
happened as follows:—After the expulsion of Dion, Dionysius,
when he sent Plato away, bade him secretly make
inquiries as to whether there was anything to prevent
Dion’s wife being bestowed upon another man; for there
was a rumour, which may have been true or merely invented
by Dion’s enemies, that the marriage had been
forced upon Dion against his will, and that he and his
wife had not lived happily together. Plato, as soon as he
arrived at Athens conversed freely with Dion, and then
wrote a letter to the despot, some of which was clearly
expressed, but which in one part intimated to him, in a
manner which he alone could understand, that the writer
had spoken about the matter to Dion, and that he would
certainly be furious if Dionysius attempted anything of
the kind. At that time, as there were still great hopes of
arranging their quarrel, Dionysius did nothing further,
but allowed his sister to remain living with her child by
Dion. When, however, they became irreconcilable <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>enemies
and Plato, after his second visit, was sent away bitterly
disliked by Dionysius, he proceeded to give Arete in
marriage, sorely against her will, to one of his friends,
named Timokrates, not imitating in this respect the
gentle conduct of his father; for the elder Dionysius also
had for an enemy Polyxenus the husband of his sister
Theste. Polyxenus, fearing for his life, escaped from
Syracuse and left Sicily. Upon this Dionysius sent for
his sister and blamed her for having known of her husband’s
intention to take flight, and not having told him
of it; but she, undismayed, answered him fearlessly,
“Dionysius, do you think me so bad and cowardly a
wife that, if I had known of the intention of my husband
to flee, I should not have accompanied him? Indeed, I did
not know of it; for it would have been more creditable to
me to have been spoken of as the wife of Polyxenus the
exile than as the sister of Dionysius the despot.” It is
said that when Theste used this bold language the despot
regarded her with admiration, and she was also so much
admired by the people of Syracuse for her courage and
goodness that after the fall of the dynasty they still continued
to treat her with the honours due to royalty, and,
when she died, all the citizens came in procession to her
funeral. These circumstances have required a digression
which is not without value.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="l22"></a> Dion after this at once prepared for war. Plato
would take no part in his attempts, both out of respect
for Dionysius and because of his own advanced age; but
Speusippus and his other companions joined Dion, and
encouraged him to set free Sicily, which they said was
stretching out its hands to him for help and would eagerly
welcome him. It seems, indeed, that when Plato was at
Syracuse, Speusippus and his friends, who mixed more with
the people, discovered their real feelings. At first they
were afraid to speak plainly, fearing that the despot was experimenting
upon them, but at length they took courage.
All told the same story, begging and encouraging Dion to
come, not with ships of war and horse and foot soldiers, but
to embark in an open boat, and lend merely his person and
his name to the Sicilians in their struggle against Dionysius.
Encouraged by these reports, which he received <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>from
Speusippus and his friends, Dion secretly levied a force
of mercenaries, but not in his own name, and without
disclosing his intention. Many statesmen and philosophers
assisted him, among the later Eudemus of Cyprus, in
whose honour, after his death, Aristotle composed his
dialogue upon the soul, and Timonides of Leukas. They
brought over to him also Miltas of Thessaly, a soothsayer
and former student of the Academy. Yet, of all those men
who had been banished by the despot, who were not less
than a thousand in number, five-and-twenty alone took
part in the expedition, and all the rest shrank from doing
so. Their starting-point was the island of Zakynthus,
where was assembled a force numbering less than eight
hundred soldiers, all of whom, however, were men of distinction
who had served in many great campaigns, and
were in admirable bodily condition, and such bold and
skilful warriors as would be able to excite and inspire with
courage the multitude which Dion hoped would rally round
him in Sicily.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="l23"></a> These men, when they heard that the expedition
was directed against Sicily and Dionysius, were at
first scared and refused to go, declaring that only the
frenzy excited by some personal quarrel, or the failure of
all reasonable hopes of success, could have led Dion to
embark upon such a desperate enterprise, and they were
incensed with their own officers and those who had
enlisted them for not having at the outset informed them
of the object of the war. When, however, Dion addressed
them, pointing out the rottenness of the monarchy, and
informing them that he was taking them, not so much
as soldiers as in order to use them as leaders for the
Syracusans and other peoples of Sicily, who had long been
ripe for revolt, and when, after Dion’s speech, Alkimenes,
one of the expedition, who was one of the most celebrated
of the Achæans both by birth and merit, spoke to the
same effect, they consented to go. The time was midsummer
and the Etesian<a id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_484_484">484</a> winds were blowing over the
sea. The moon was at the full. Dion prepared a magnificent
sacrifice to Apollo and marched in solemn procession
to the temple with his soldiers, all arrayed in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>complete armour. After the sacrifice he feasted them in
the stadium or race-course of the people of Zakynthus,
where they had an opportunity of admiring the splendour
of his gold and silver plate, and reflected that a man past
middle life, as he was, and possessed of such wealth,
would never attempt an extravagant enterprise without
reasonable expectation of success, or unless his friends
upon the spot had promised to furnish him with abundant
resources.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="l24"></a> Just after the libations<a id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_485_485">485</a> and customary
prayers, the moon became eclipsed. Dion and his
friends saw nothing remarkable in this, as they could
calculate the periods of eclipses, and knew how the
shadow was produced upon the moon by the interposition
of the earth between it and the sun. As, however, the
soldiers were alarmed at the portent and required some
encouragement, Miltas the soothsayer came into the
midst of them and addressed them, bidding them be of
good cheer and expect the most complete success; for
the gods, he declared, foretold by this sign that something
brilliant would be extinguished. Now there was nothing
more brilliant than the monarchy of Dionysius, whose
light was fated to be quenched by them as soon as they
arrived at Sicily. This interpretation Miltas told to them
all; but when a swarm of bees was seen to settle on the
sterns of the ships, he privately told Dion and his friends
that he feared lest this might portend that at first they
would be very properous, but that after blooming for a
short time their prosperity would wither away. It is said,
too, that many ominous signs were vouchsafed by Heaven
to Dionysius. An eagle snatched up a spear from one of
the life-guards, soared aloft with it, and let it fall into the
sea; and one day the sea-water which washes the walls
of the citadel became quite sweet and drinkable, so that
all men noticed it. Swine also were born without ears,
though perfect in all other parts. This was interpreted
by the soothsayers to be a sign of insurrection and
disobedience, and to mean that the people would no
longer hearken to the commands of the despot, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>portent of the sea-water meant that after bitter miseries
sweet and pleasant times were in store for the people of
Syracuse. The eagle, they said, is the servant of Zeus,
and the spear is the symbol of power and sovereignty;
wherefore the greatest of the gods must intend to sink
and destroy the monarchy. These incidents we are told
by Theopompus.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="l25"></a> The soldiers of Dion were contained in two
merchant-ships, which were accompanied by another small
vessel and two galleys of thirty oars.<a id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_486_486">486</a> Besides the arms
carried by the soldiers, Dion took with him two thousand
shields, many spears and missiles, and sufficient provisions
to supply them during the whole voyage, which was to
be performed entirely under canvass and over the open
sea, because they feared to approach the land, and had
learned that Philistus was cruising off the Iapygian Cape
with a squadron to intercept them. Sailing with a light
and gentle wind for twelve days, on the thirteenth they
reached Pachynus, the southern extremity of Sicily. Here
Protus their pilot bade them make haste to disembark,
warning them that if they left the land and steered away
from the cape, they would be obliged to spend many days
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>and nights at sea during the summer season, when a
southerly gale might be expected. Dion, however, feared
to disembark so near his foes, and, wishing to land further
away, sailed along the coast past Cape Pachynus. Hereupon
a violent northerly wind, accompanied by a high sea,
drove the ships away from Sicily, while at the rising of
Arcturus a storm of thunder and lightning burst upon
them with furious rain. At this the sailors became dismayed,
and lost their reckoning, but suddenly found that
the ships were being carried by the waves towards the
rockiest and most precipitous cliffs of the island Kerkina,<a id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_487_487">487</a>
off the coast of Libya. They narrowly escaped being
dashed to pieces upon the rocks, but struggled along, keeping
themselves off the land with punting-poles,<a id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_488_488">488</a> until at
length the storm abated and they learned from a vessel which
they fell in with that they were near what are called the
“Heads” of the Great Syrtis. It now fell calm and they
became disheartened and quarrelled with one another; but
soon an off-shore wind sprang up from the south, though
they, not expecting a southerly wind, could scarcely
believe in the change. The wind gradually increased in
force, and they, setting all the sail they were able, and
commending themselves in prayer to the gods, crossed the
open sea from Libya to Sicily before the wind. They
made a quick passage, and on the fifth day came to an
anchor at Minoa, a small city in that part of Sicily which
belonged to the Carthaginians. The Carthaginian commander,
Synalus, who was a friend of Dion, happened to be
present in the town. Not knowing what the expedition
was, or that Dion, was with it, he attempted to prevent
the soldiers from landing; but they poured out of their
ships fully armed, and though in accordance with Dion’s
order they killed no one, because of his friendship with
the Carthaginian leader, yet they routed the Minoans,
entered their city with the fugitives, and captured it.
When the two chiefs met, they embraced one another, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>Dion restored the city to Synalus without doing it any
hurt, while Synalus showed hospitality to the soldiers and
provided Dion with the supplies which he needed.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="l26"></a> What specially encouraged them was the absence
of Dionysius from Syracuse, although they had no hand
in bringing it about; for he had just started on a voyage
to the coast of Italy with a fleet of eighty ships. Although
Dion begged his soldiers to wait and recruit their strength
after the hardships of their long sea voyage, they would
not remain there, but in their eagerness to seize this
favourable opportunity bade Dion lead them to Syracuse.
Dion now left behind his surplus arms and baggage at
Minoa, and, begging Synalus to send them on to him when
he should have need of them, set out on his march to
Syracuse. On the road, he was first joined by two hundred
horsemen, citizens of Agrigentum, dwelling near Eknomon.
After these, some of the people of Gela also joined his army.</p>
<p>The news of Dion’s march soon reached Syracuse, and
Timokrates, the husband of Dion’s late wife, the sister of
Dionysius, who was left in charge of the garrison, sent a
messenger in great haste to Dionysius with a letter telling
of Dion’s arrival. He himself endeavoured to maintain
order and put down all insurrections in the city, for all
the people were excited at the news, but remained quiet
as yet, through fear and doubt. Meantime a strange mischance
befel the bearer of the letter to Dionysius. He
crossed the straits to Italy, passed through the city of
Rhegium, and as he hurried on towards Kaulonia, where
Dionysius was, he fell in with one of his friends, carrying
a newly slaughtered victim. He was given a piece of meat
by the man, and went on in haste. He walked some part
of the night, but being forced by fatigue to take a little
sleep, he lay down, just as he was, in a wood by the road-side.
While he slept, a wolf, attracted by the smell,
snatched up the meat, which he had tied to his wallet, and
ran off with it, carrying away with it the wallet in which
the man had placed the letter. When the man woke and
discovered his loss, after much vain searching, as he could
not find it, he decided not to go to the despot without the
letter, but to make off and keep out of the way.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="l27"></a> In consequence of this Dionysius only <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>heard
of the war in Sicily much later and from other persons,
and meanwhile Dion had been joined on his march by the
people of Kamarina, and by a considerable number of
the Syracusans who lived in the country. The Leontines
and Campanians, who formed the garrison of Epipolæ, in
consequence of Dion’s sending them a false report that he
intended to attack their city first, left Timokrates, and
went away thither to defend their own property. When
news of this reached Dion, who was encamped near Akræ,
he aroused his soldiers while it was yet night and marched
to the river Anapus, which is ten stadia distant from the
city. There he halted and offered sacrifice beside the
river, praying to the rising sun, and at the same time the
soothsayers declared that the gods would give him the
victory. Observing that Dion wore a garland because he
was sacrificing, all those who were present at the sacrifice
with one impulse crowned themselves with flowers. No
less than five thousand men had joined him on his march.
They were badly armed in a make-shift fashion, but their
zeal supplied the deficiencies of their equipment, and when
Dion led the way they all started at a run, shouting for
joy, and encouraging one another to recover their freedom.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="l28"></a> Of the Syracusans within the walls, the chief
men and upper classes in their most splendid raiment met
Dion at the gates, while the populace attacked the friends
of the despot, and seized upon the spies, a wicked and
hateful class of men, who used to live among the people
of the city and report their opinions and conversations to
the despot. These men were the first to suffer for their
crimes, as they were beaten to death by any of the citizens
who fell in with them. Timokrates, unable to reach the
garrison of the citadel, mounted his horse and rode away
from the city, spreading alarm and confusion everywhere
as he fled by exaggerating the numbers of Dion’s army,
that he might not be thought to have surrendered the city
through fear to a small force.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dion could already be seen plainly, as he
marched first of all his men, clad in splendid armour. On
one side of him was his brother Megakles, and on the
other the Athenian Kallippus, both crowned with garlands.
Next marched a hundred of the mercenary soldiers, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>a
body-guard for Dion, while the rest of the men were led
on by their officers in battle array. The entire procession
was looked upon and welcomed as though it were sacred
by the citizens of Syracuse, who, after forty-two years of
tyranny, saw liberty and a popular constitution restored
to their city.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="l29"></a> When Dion had entered by the Temenitid<a id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_489_489">489</a>
gate, he caused his trumpet to sound to obtain silence;
and then a herald made proclamation that Dion and Megakles
were come to put down the monarchy, and that
they set free from the despot both the Syracusans and the
other Sicilian Greeks.</p>
<p>As Dion wished to address the people in person, he proceeded
through Achradina, while the Syracusans placed
animals for sacrifice, tables and bowls of wine on each
side of the street,<a id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_490_490">490</a> and each, as Dion passed them, strewed
flowers in his path and addressed prayers to him as if to
a god. In front of the citadel, with its Pentapyla, or
Five Gates, stood a sundial, a conspicuous and lofty work,
erected by Dionysius. Dion mounted upon this, and
addressed the citizens, encouraging them to hold fast the
freedom which they had obtained. The people, in joy and
gratitude to them, elected them both generals, with unlimited
powers, and at their earnest request chose twenty
more as their colleagues, half of whom were taken from
the exiles who had returned with Dion. The prophets
considered it to be an excellent omen that Dion, while
addressing the people, should have trodden under his feet
the building which the despot had reared in his pride;
but they augured ill from his having been chosen general
while standing upon a sundial, lest his fortunes should
soon experience some revolution. After this he captured
Epipolae, released the citizens who were imprisoned there
and cut off the citadel by a palisade.<a id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_491_491">491</a> On the seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>day after this, Dionysius returned to the citadel by sea,
and waggons arrived bringing to Dion the arms and armour
which he had left with Synalus. These he distributed
among the citizens, and of the others, each man equipped
himself as well as he was able, and eagerly offered his
services as a soldier.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="l30"></a> Dionysius at first sent ambassadors privately to
Dion to endeavour to corrupt him. Afterwards, as Dion
bade him speak openly to the people of Syracuse, who were
now free, Dionysius through his ambassadors made them
attractive offers of moderate taxation and moderate military
service, subject to their own vote of consent.<a id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_492_492">492</a> These
proposals were scornfully rejected by the Syracusans.
Dion told the ambassadors that he and his party could
have no dealings with Dionysius unless he abdicated; but
that if he did so, he himself, remembering their relationship,
would answer for his personal safety, and obtain as
good terms for him as could be reasonably expected.
These conditions were approved by Dionysius, who again
sent ambassadors to demand that some of the Syracusans
should come to the citadel and arrange the terms of the
surrender upon a basis of mutual concessions. Commissioners,
chosen by Dion, were at once sent to him, and
a report spread from the citadel that Dionysius intended
to abdicate and to make himself more popular even than
Dion. However, the negotiations were all a trick of the
despot to take the Syracusans at a disadvantage. He
imprisoned the commissioners, and at daybreak, having
excited his mercenary troops with wine, sent them at a run
to attack the Syracusan wall across the isthmus. This
attack was unexpected, and the foreign troops boldly and
with loud shouts began to destroy the works and to attack
the Syracusans. No one could withstand their onset except
the mercenaries of Dion, who were the first to hear the
noise of the conflict and to rush to the spot. But not
even these men could perceive what was to be done or
obey their orders, mixed up as they were with noisy crowds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
of panic-stricken Syracusan fugitives, before Dion, finding
that no one heeded his words, and wishing to show by
his actions what ought to be done, was the first man to
attack the foreigners. Round him a fierce and terrible
battle took place, as he was recognised as well by the
enemy as by his friends, and all ran towards him with
shouts. He was, indeed, somewhat advanced in years to
engage in such a furious combat, but yet stoutly and
bravely withstood and repulsed all who attacked him. He
received a wound in the hand from a spear, and had to
rely upon his breastplate for protection against showers
of darts and blows in close combat, for his shield was
pierced through by many spears and lances. When these
were broken he fell to the ground, but was snatched away
by his soldiers. He appointed Timonides to take his place,
and himself rode through the city on horseback, rallied the
Syracusan fugitives, brought out the garrison of mercenaries
from Achradina, and led these fresh and confident
troops against the wearied foreigners, who had already
begun to despair of victory. They had imagined that by
their first attack they would be able to overrun the whole
city, but having unexpectedly fallen in with men who
could deal hard blows they began to retire towards the
citadel. As they gave way the Greeks pressed upon them
still more, until at length they were driven in confusion
into the citadel, after killing seventy-four of Dion’s party,
and losing many of their own men.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="l31"></a> After this glorious victory the Syracusans presented
the mercenaries with a hundred minae, and the
mercenaries presented Dion with a golden crown.
Heralds from Dionysius now came from the citadel bringing
letters to Dion from his female relatives. One of these
bore the superscription “From Hipparinus to his father;”
for this was the name of Dion’s son, although Timæus
says that he was named Aretaeus after his mother Arete.
But I imagine we ought rather to believe Timonides in
such matters as these, since he was a friend and comrade of
Dion. The other letters, those from the women, which
were full of piteous supplications, were read aloud to the
Syracusans, but they were unwilling that the letter from
the child should be opened before them. In spite of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>their
opposition, Dion opened it and read it aloud. It was from
Dionysius himself, addressed nominally to Dion, but really
to the people of Syracuse, and though in it Dionysius
seemed to appeal to Dion and to plead his own cause with
him, yet in truth it was concocted with a view to rendering
him suspected by the people; for it contained allusions
to his former zeal on behalf of the monarchy, and also
threatened him through the persons of those dearest to
him, his sister, his child and his wife. There were in
the letter also pitiful entreaties, and what especially
moved him to anger, supplications to him not to destroy
the monarchy and set free a people which hated him and
would turn and rend him, but to become despot himself,
and thus to save his relatives and friends.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="l32"></a> When these letters were read to them, the
Syracusans, instead of admiring Dion for his magnanimity
in adhering to the cause of honour and right, in
spite of such touching appeals as these, they rather
began to suspect him and to fear him, because he had
such powerful reasons for sparing the despot, and they
began to look around them for some other leader. They
became particularly excited on hearing that Herakleides
sailed into the harbour. This Herakleides was a Syracusan
exile, a military man who had gained a great reputation
by the commands which he had held in the service
of Dionysius and his father, but of an unsettled disposition,
fickle and least of all to be relied upon when associated
with a colleague in any command of dignity and honour.
This man had quarrelled with Dion in Peloponnesus,
and determined to make an expedition of his own to attack
Dionysius. He now arrived at Syracuse with seven triremes
and three other vessels,<a id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_493_493">493</a> and found Dionysius blockaded in
his citadel and the people of Syracuse in an excited condition.
He at once received the popular favour, being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>naturally plausible and well able to impose upon a people
who were fond of flattery. He was the more easily enabled
to do this, as the Syracusans were already disgusted
with the haughty demeanour of Dion, which they considered
to be offensive and unfit for a statesman, being
themselves grown insubordinate and insolent after their
victory and requiring a demagogue even before they had
become a democracy.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="l33"></a> Their first act was to assemble of their own
accord and elect Herakleides as admiral. When, however,
Dion came forward and complained that the appointment
of Herakleides was a revocation of the powers granted to
himself, since he would no longer be general with unlimited
powers, if another commanded by sea, the Syracusans,
much against their will, annulled the election.
After this Dion sent for Herakleides privately and, after
bitterly reproaching him with his want of honour and
right feeling in raising disputes about precedence during
so momentous and dangerous a crisis, again assembled
the people, appointed Herakleides admiral and prevailed
upon the citizens to grant him a body-guard such as that
by which he himself was attended. Herakleides now
in words and in manner acknowledged Dion as his superior,
obeyed his orders with humility, and owned that he
owed him a debt of gratitude; but in secret he encouraged
the people to revolt against him, stirred up tumults
and brought Dion into a most difficult position; for if he
were to permit Dionysius to retire from the citadel under
a flag of truce, he feared that he should be reproached
with sparing the despot and saving him from the fate
he deserved, while, if he did not push the siege through a
wish not to drive him to extremities, he would appear to
be purposely protracting the war in order that he might
the longer remain in power and have the people under
his orders.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="l34"></a> There was one Sosis, a man who by villainy
and audacity had gained a certain reputation at Syracuse,
where the citizens thought that his licence in speech must
be prompted by an excessive love of freedom. This man
began to intrigue against Dion, and first of all rose in the
assembly and violently abused the Syracusans for <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>not
perceiving that they had got a sober and vigilant despot
instead of a drunken and imbecile one. After this, having
avowed himself Dion’s open enemy, he withdrew from
the market-place and next day was seen running naked
through the city with his face and head covered with
blood, as though he were fleeing from some pursuers.
Rushing into the market-place in this condition, he said
that his life had been attempted by Dion’s mercenaries,
and showed his wounded head to the people. He at once
gained an audience of sympathisers, who became furious
with Dion, and declared that he was acting shamefully
and despotically in restraining the freedom of speech of
the citizens by threats and murders. However, though a
disorderly assembly took place, Dion was able to speak in
his own defence, pointing out that a brother of Sosis was
one of the guards of Dionysius, and that this man must
have persuaded him to rebel and throw the city into
confusion, since Dionysius could have no hope of safety
except in the dissensions of the besiegers. At the same
time the physicians examined the wound of Sosis, and
found that it was the result of a superficial scratch rather
than of a downward cut; for wounds by swordstrokes are
deepest in the middle, because of the weight of the blow,
while this wound of Sosis was shallow throughout all its
length and had several beginnings, as probably he had been
forced by the pain to leave off cutting his head and then
had begun again. Some of the more respectable citizens
also came to the assembly with a razor, and said that
while they were walking they met Sosis covered with
blood, saying that he was fleeing from Dion’s mercenaries
and had just been wounded by them. They at once proceeded
to look for them, and found no man, but saw the
razor hidden under a hollow stone at the place from
which Sosis had been seen coming out.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="l35"></a> Matters now began to look ill for Sosis; and
when his slaves, after torture, declared that he left the
house while it was yet night carrying a razor, Dion’s
accusers withdrew their charges against him, and the
people became reconciled with Dion and condemned Sosis
to death. Nevertheless, they viewed the mercenaries with
suspicion, especially after the great battles which <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>took
place at sea, when Philistus came from Iapygia with
many triremes to rescue Dionysius, upon which they
imagined that the mercenaries, being heavy-infantry
soldiers, would be of no further use in the war, and would
soon become their enemies, as they were all seafaring
people, whose strength lay in their ships. They were
further excited by their success in a sea-fight, in which
they defeated Philistus, and treated him with the utmost
barbarity. Ephorus states that Philistus killed himself as
soon as his ship was captured, but Timonides, who was
present with Dion throughout the whole of these events,
in a letter which he wrote to the philospher, Speusippus,
informs him that Philistus was taken alive from his ship
which ran ashore; and that the Syracusans first stripped
him of his corslet and displayed him naked, jeering at
him, he being then an old man; and that after this they
cut off his head and gave up the body to the boys of the
town, bidding them drag it through Achradina, and cast
it into the stone quarries. Timæus declares that Philistus
was treated with even greater indignity, his dead body
being dragged by the boys through the city by the lame
leg amidst the insults of all the people of Syracuse, who
were pleased to see this treatment inflicted on the man
who had told Dionysius that far from requiring a swift
horse to escape from his throne, he ought to remain until
he was dragged from it by the leg. Philistus, however,
gave this advice to Dionysius, not as having been said by
himself, but by some one else.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="l36"></a> Philistus doubtless laid himself open to blame
by his zealous adherence to the cause of the monarchy,
but Timæus takes advantage of this to satisfy his own
spite by abusing him. It might, perhaps, be pardoned if
those who had been wronged by him were so transported
by rage as even to insult his senseless corpse; but a
historian, writing an account of his actions in a later age,
without having been in any way personally injured by
him, ought to be restrained by feelings of honour and
decency from taunting him with his misfortunes, which,
indeed, might equally have befallen the best of men
Neither does Ephorus show a sound judgment in praising
Philistus, for, in spite of his skill in inventing <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>good
motives for evil conduct and actions, and the care with
which his words are chosen, he cannot, with all his art,
gloss over the fact that Philistus was devotedly attached
to the cause of despotism, and that he, more than any one
else, was dazzled and attracted by wealth, power, luxury
and marriages with the daughters of absolute princes. A
historian would show better taste than either of these by
neither praising Philistus for his conduct nor reproaching
him with his misfortunes.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="l37"></a> After the death of Philistus, Dionysius sent
to Dion offering to deliver up to him the citadel, the arms
which it contained, the mercenary troops and five months
pay for them, and demanding to be allowed to retire unmolested
to Italy and live there, and also to receive the
revenues of a large and fertile tract belonging to Syracuse
called Gyarta, which extended from the sea-side to the
interior of the island. Dion would not receive the
embassy, but bade Dionysius address himself to the people
of Syracuse; and they, hoping to take Dionysius alive,
drove away his ambassadors. Dionysius now handed over
the citadel to Apollokrates, his eldest son, and himself
placed what persons and property he chiefly valued on
board ship, waited for a fair wind, and then sailed away,
eluding the vigilance of the admiral Herakleides.
Herakleides was fiercely reproached by the citizens for
his neglect, but suborned one of the popular speakers to
make proposals to the people for a division of lands, pointing
out that equality is the source of freedom, and that
poverty reduces men to slavery. Herakleides spoke on
the same side, openly opposed Dion, who led the opposite
faction, and prevailed upon the Syracusans to agree to this
proposal, and further to refuse to pay the mercenary
troops and to rid themselves of the haughty arrogance of
Dion by electing new generals. Thus, like a man who
attempts to rise and walk when weakened by a long illness,
the Syracusans, after ridding themselves of their despotism,
at once tried to adopt the institutions of free
peoples, and both failed in their undertakings and disliked
Dion, because he, like a careful physician, wished
to impose a strict and temperate regimen upon them.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="l38"></a> When they assembled to choose their <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>new
commanders the time was about midsummer, and ominous
thunderstorms and portents took place for fifteen days in
succession, dispersing the people and preventing their
election of any other generals. When the popular leaders,
by waiting and watching, had obtained a fair still day for
the election of chief magistrates, a draught ox, who was
quite tame and accustomed to crowds, but who was enraged
with his driver, broke from his yoke and ran towards
the theatre. He scattered the people in the greatest confusion
and panic, and ran on prancing and causing disorder
through all that part of the city which afterwards
fell into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, the Syracusans
disregarded this omen, and elected five-and-twenty
generals, one of whom was Herakleides. They also made
secret overtures to Dion’s mercenaries, inviting them to
desert, and offering them equal rights with the other
citizens. They, however, would not listen to these proposals,
but faithfully and promptly got under arms, formed
column with Dion in their midst, and began to march out
of the city, without harming any one, but bitterly reproaching
all whom they met with their ingratitude and
wickedness. But the Syracusans, who despised them for
their small numbers and for not having been the first to
attack, had now collected in crowds, far outnumbering the
mercenaries, and set upon them, expecting that in a street-fight
they would easily be able to overpower them and to
kill them all.</p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="l39"></a> In this terrible dilemma, as he was forced
either to fight against his fellow-countrymen or to perish
with his mercenaries, Dion stretched out his hands towards
the Syracusans and implored them to desist, and pointed
to the citadel, full of armed enemies, who were watching
them from the battlements. As, however, the excited
mob could not be turned from its purpose, for the speeches
of the demagogues stirred up the people as the wind stirs
up the waves of the sea, Dion ordered his troops not to
charge them, but to march forward with a shout and
martial clash of arms. At this none of the Syracusans
stood their ground, but ran away along the streets unpursued;
for Dion at once wheeled round his troops and
marched away to Leontini. The new chiefs of the Syracusans,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
ridiculed by the women, and wishing to wipe out
their disgrace, now again got the citizens under arms and
pursued Dion. They came up with him as he was crossing
a stream, and rode up to his troops in skirmishing order.
When, however, they perceived that Dion was no longer
willing to deal gently and paternally with their follies,
but that he angrily formed his troops in line and
ordered them to attack, they fled more disgracefully
than before back to their city, without losing many of
their number.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="l40"></a> The people of Leontini received Dion with especial
honours, provided his troops with pay, and made them
free of the city. They also sent ambassadors to the Syracusans,
calling upon them to do the soldiers justice; to
which they replied by sending ambassadors to prefer
charges against Dion. When, however, all the allies
held a meeting at Leontini and discussed the matter, the
Syracusans were held to be in fault. But the Syracusans
refused to accept this decision, as they were now full of
insolent importance, having no one to rule them, but
being led by generals who were the merest slaves of the
people.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="l41"></a> After this a fleet of triremes sent by Dionysius
arrived at the city, under the command of Nypsius, a
Neapolitan, with supplies of corn and money for the besieged.
In a sea-fight which took place the Syracusans
were victorious, and took four of the ships, but were so
elated by their victory, and, having none to rule them,
celebrated their success with such reckless excesses of
drinking and feasting, that while they imagined they had
taken the citadel they really lost the city as well; for
Nypsius, observing that discipline was everywhere at an
end, as the populace were engaged in drinking to the
sound of music from daylight until late at night, and that
the generals were delighted at the festivity and were unwilling
to summon the drunken men to their duty, seized
his opportunity and attacked the Syracusan wall of investment.
His attack succeeded; he broke through the
works, and at once let loose his foreign mercenaries,
bidding them deal as they pleased with all whom they met.
The Syracusans, though they soon learned their misfortune,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
yet were slow to assemble, being taken by surprise;
for the city was being sacked, the men slaughtered, the
walls thrown down and the women and children being
forced weeping into the citadel, while the generals gave
up all for lost, and could make no use of the citizens,
who were everywhere confusedly mixed up with the
enemy.</p>
<p>XLII.<a id="l42"></a> While the city was in this condition, and the
danger began to menace Achradina also, all men thought
of him who was their last and only hope, but no one spoke
of Dion, as they were all ashamed of the folly and ingratitude
with which they had treated him. Sheer necessity,
however, forced some of the auxiliary troops and the
knights<a id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_494_494">494</a> to cry out that they must send for Dion and his
Peloponnesians from Leontini. As soon as any were found
bold enough to raise this cry, the Syracusans shouted
aloud, and rejoiced with tears, for they prayed that Dion
would come, they longed to see him, and they remembered
his courage and strength in time of danger, in which he
not only remained calm and unmoved, but gave them
confidence by his demeanour and caused them fearlessly
and bravely to attack their enemies. They therefore at
once sent off to him Archonides and Telesides, as representatives
of the allies, and Hellanikus, with four others, of
the knights. These men rode at full gallop to Leontini,
arriving there late in the afternoon. When they dismounted,
the first person they met was Dion, and with
tears in their eyes they told him of the misfortunes
which had befallen the Syracusans. Soon some of the
citizens of Leontini fell in with them, and many of the
Peloponnesians gathered round Dion, suspecting from the
earnest and supplicatory tones and gestures of the
ambassadors that something important had happened.
Dion at once led the way to the public assembly, where all
the people soon met together. Archonides and Hellanikus
in a few words informed them of the great misfortune
which had befallen the Syracusans, and besought the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>stranger mercenaries to help them and not to bear malice
for the treatment which they had received, since the
Syracusans had been more terribly punished for their
misconduct than even the soldiers could have wished them
to be.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="l43"></a> After they had ceased speaking, there was a
great silence; and when Dion rose and began to speak,
tears choked his utterance. The Peloponnesians encouraged
him, and showed sympathy with him, and at
length he mastered his emotion and said: “Men of Peloponnesus
and Allies, I have assembled you here to deliberate
about your own affairs. As for myself, I cannot
with honour deliberate while Syracuse is being destroyed,
but if I cannot save my country, I will share her ruin and
make her flames my own funeral pyre. As for you, if
you can bring yourselves even now, after all that has passed,
to help us, the most ill-advised and the most ill-fated of
men, restore again by your own means alone the city of
Syracuse. But if you hate the Syracusans and reject their
appeal, then may you be rewarded by heaven for your
former brave conduct and loyalty to me, and may you
remember Dion, who would not desert you when you were
wronged, and would not afterwards desert his fellow-countrymen
when they were in trouble.” While Dion
was still speaking, the Peloponnesians leaped up with a
shout, bidding him lead them as quickly as possible to
the rescue, and the ambassadors from Syracuse embraced
him, calling upon heaven to bless both him and the
troops. When order was restored, Dion immediately began
to prepare for the march, and ordered his men to go and
eat their dinners at once, and then to assemble under arms
in that very place; for he intended to march to Syracuse
by night.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="l44"></a> Meanwhile at Syracuse the generals of Dionysius
worked great ruin in the city while it was day, but when
darkness came on retired into the citadel, having lost but
few men. The popular leaders now took courage, and,
expecting that the enemy would attempt nothing further,
again called upon the people to have nothing to do with
Dion, and, if he came with his foreign troops, not to admit
him into the city and own themselves inferior to his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>men
in courage, but to reconquer their city and their liberty
by their own exertions. More embassies were now sent
to Dion, from the generals dissuading him from coming,
and from the knights and leading citizens entreating him
to come quickly. This caused him to march more slowly,
yet with greater determination. When day broke, the
party opposed to Dion occupied the gates, in order to shut
him out of the city, while Nypsius a second time led out
the mercenaries from the citadel, in greater numbers and
far more confident than before. He at once levelled to the
ground the whole of the works by which the citadel was
cut off from the main land, and overran and pillaged the
city. No longer men alone, but even women and children
were slaughtered, and property of every kind mercilessly
destroyed; for Dionysius, who now despaired of ultimate
success, and bitterly hated the Syracusans, wished only, as
it were, to bury the monarchy in the ruins of the city.
In order to effect their purpose before Dion could come to
the rescue, the soldiers destroyed the houses in the quickest
way by setting them on fire, using torches for those near
at hand, and shooting fiery arrows to those at a distance.
As the Syracusans fled from their burning dwellings, some
were caught and butchered in the streets, while others
who took refuge in the houses perished in the flames, as
now a large number of houses were burning, and kept
falling upon the passers by.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="l45"></a> This misfortune more than anything else caused
all to be unanimous in opening the gates to Dion. He had
been marching slowly, as he heard that the enemy were
shut up in the citadel; but as the day went on, at first
some of the knights rode up to him and told him of the
second occupation of the city; and afterwards some even
of the opposite faction arrived and begged him to hasten
his march. As the danger became more pressing, Herakleides
sent first his brother, and afterwards his uncle
Theodotus, to beseech Dion to assist them, and to tell him
that no one any longer could offer any resistance, that
Herakleides himself was wounded, and that the whole city
was within a little of being totally ruined and burned.
When these messages reached Dion he was still sixty
stadia distant from the gates of Syracuse. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>explained
to his troops the danger the city was in, spoke some words
of encouragement to them, and then led them on, no longer
at a walk, but at a run, while messenger after messenger
continued to meet them and urge them to haste. At the
head of his mercenaries, who displayed extraordinary
speed and spirit, Dion made his way through the gates
of Syracuse to the place called Hekatompedon. He at
once sent his light-armed troops to attack the enemy, and
to encourage the Syracusans by their presence, while he
himself formed his own heavy infantry, and those of the
citizens who rallied round him in separate columns under
several commanders, in order to create greater terror by
attacking the enemy at many points at once.</p>
<p>XLVI.<a id="l46"></a> When, after making these preparations, and
offering prayer to the gods, he was beheld leading his
troops through the city to attack the enemy, the Syracusans
raised a shout of joy, with a confused murmur of prayers,
entreaties and congratulations, addressing Dion as their
saviour and their tutelary god, and calling the foreign
soldiers their brethren and fellow-citizens. All of them,
even the most selfish and cowardly, now appeared to hold
Dion’s life dearer than his own or that of his fellow-citizens,
as they saw him lead the way to danger through blood and
fire, and over the corpses which lay in heaps in the streets.
The enemy, too, presented a formidable appearance, for they
were exasperated to fury, and had established themselves
in a strong position, hard even to approach, amidst the
ruins of the rampart by which the citadel had been cut off
from the town; while the progress of the mercenary troops
was rendered difficult and dangerous by the flames of the
burning houses by which they were surrounded. They
were forced to leap over heaps of blazing beams, and to
run from under great masses of falling ruins, struggling
forwards through thick smoke and choking dust, and yet
striving to keep their ranks unbroken. When at length
they reached the enemy, only a few could fight on either
side, because of the narrowness of the path, but the
Syracusans, pushing confidently forward with loud shouts,
forced the troops of Nypsius to give way. Most of them
escaped into the citadel, which was close at hand: but all
the stragglers who were left outside, were pursued and
put to death by the Peloponnesians. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>Syracusans
could not spare any time to enjoy their victory and to
congratulate one another after such great successes, but
betook themselves at once to extinguishing their burning
houses, and with great exertions put out the fire during
the night.</p>
<p>XLVII.<a id="l47"></a> As soon as day broke, all the popular leaders,
conscious of their guilt, left the city, with the exception
of Herakleides and Theodotus, who went of their own
accord and delivered themselves up to Dion, admitting
that they had done wrong, and begging that he would
treat them better than they had treated him. They pointed
out, also, how much he would enhance the lustre of his
other incomparable virtues by showing himself superior
even in the matter of temper to those by whom he had
been wronged, who now came before him admitting that
in their rivalry with him they had been overcome by his
virtue. When Herakleides and his companion thus threw
themselves upon the mercy of Dion, his friends advised
him not to spare such envious and malignant wretches,
but to deliver up Herakleides to his soldiers, and thus to
put an end to mob rule, an evil quite as pestilent as
despotism itself. Dion, however, calmed their anger,
observing that other generals spent most of their time in
practising war and the use of arms; but that he, during
his long sojourn in the Academy, had learned to subdue
his passions, and to show himself superior to jealousy of
his rivals. True greatness of mind, he said, could be
better shown by forgiving those by whom one has been
wronged, than by doing good to one’s friends and benefactors;
and he desired not so much to excel Herakleides
in power and generalship, as in clemency and justice, the
only qualities which are truly good: for our successes in
war, even if won by ourselves alone, yet can only be won
by the aid of Fortune. “If,” he continued, “Herakleides
be jealous, treacherous and base, that is no reason for Dion
to stain his glory by yielding to his anger; for though to
revenge a wrong is held to be less culpable than to
commit one, yet both alike spring from the weakness of
human nature: while even though a man be wicked, yet
he is seldom so hopelessly depraved as not to be touched
by one who repeatedly returns good for evil.”</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="l48"></a> After expressing himself thus, Dion <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>released
Herakleides. He next turned his attention to the fortification
by which the citadel was cut off, and ordered each
Syracusan to cut a stake and bring it to the spot. He
allowed the citizens to rest during the night, but kept his
mercenary soldiers at work, and by the next morning had
completed the palisade, so that both the enemy and his own
countrymen were astonished at the speed with, which he
had accomplished so great a work. He now buried the
corpses of those citizens who had fallen in the battle,
ransomed the prisoners, who amounted to no less
than two thousand, and summoned an assembly, in which
Herakleides proposed that Dion should be appointed
absolute commander by land and by sea. All the better
citizens approved of this, and wished it to be put to the
vote, but it was thrown out by the interference of the mob
of sailors and people of the lower classes, who were sorry
that Herakleides had lost his post as admiral, and who
thought that, although he might be worthless in all other
respects, he was at any rate more of a friend to the people
than Dion, and more easily managed by them. Dion conceded
so much to them as to give Herakleides command of
the fleet, but vexed them much by opposing their plans
for a redistribution of land and houses, and by declaring
void all that they had decided upon this subject. In consequence
of this Herakleides, who at once entered upon his
office of admiral, sailed to Messenia, and there by his
harangues excited the sailors and soldiers under his
command to mutiny against Dion, who, he declared,
intended to make himself despot of Syracuse; while he, in
the meanwhile, entered upon negotiations with Dionysius
by means of the Spartan Pharax. When this was discovered
by the Syracusan nobility, a violent quarrel arose
in his camp, which led to the people of Syracuse being
reduced to great want and scarcity, so that Dion was at
his wit’s end, and was bitterly reproached by his friends
for having placed such an unmanageable and villainous
rival as Herakleides in possession of power which he used
against his benefactor.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="l49"></a> Pharax was now encamped at Neapolis, in the
territory of Agrigentum, and Dion, who led out the
Syracusans to oppose him, wished to defer an engagement;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
but Herakleides and the sailors overwhelmed him with
their clamour, saying that he did not wish to bring the
war to an end by a battle, but to keep it constantly going
on in order that he might remain the longer in command.
He therefore fought and was beaten. The defeat was not
a disastrous one, but was due more to the confusion produced
by the quarrels of his own men than to the enemy.
Dion therefore prepared to renew the engagement, drew
out his men in battle array, and addressed them in encouraging
terms. Towards evening, however, he heard
that Herakleides had weighed anchor and sailed away to
Syracuse with the fleet, with the intention of seizing the
city and shutting its gates against Dion and the army.
Dion at once took the strongest and bravest men with him,
and rode all night, reaching the gates of Syracuse about
the third hour of the next day, after a journey of seven
hundred stadia. Herakleides, who in spite of the exertions
of his fleet was beaten in the race, was at a loss what
to do, and sailed away aimlessly. He chanced to fall in
with the Spartan Gæsylus, who informed him that he was
coming from Lacedæmon to take command of the Sicilian
Greeks, as Gylippus had done in former times. Herakleides
was delighted at having met this man, and
displayed him to his troops, boasting that he had found a
counterpoise to the power of Dion, he at once sent a
herald to Syracuse, and ordered the citizens to receive the
Spartan as their ruler. When Dion answered that the
Syracusans had rulers enough, and that in case they should
require a Spartan to command them, he himself was a
Spartan by adoption, Gæsylus gave up all claims to command,
but went to Dion and reconciled Herakleides to him,
making Herakleides swear the greatest oaths and give the
strongest pledges for his future good behaviour, while
Gæsylus himself swore that he would avenge Dion and
punish Herakleides in case the latter should misconduct
himself.</p>
<p>L.<a id="l50"></a> After this the Syracusans disbanded their navy,
which was quite useless; besides being very expensive to
the crews, and giving opportunities for the formation of
plots against the government; but they continued the
siege of the citadel, and thoroughly completed the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>wall
across the isthmus. As no assistance arrived for the
besieged, while their provisions began to fail, and their
troops became inclined to mutiny, the son of Dionysius
despaired of success, arranged terms of capitulation with
Dion, handed over the citadel to him together with all the
arms and other war material which it contained, and
himself, taking his mother and sisters and their property
on board of five triremes, sailed away to his father. Dion,
permitted him to leave in safety, and his departure was
witnessed by every one of the Syracusans, who even called
upon the names of those who were absent, and were
unable to see this day when the sun rose upon a free
Syracuse. Indeed the downfall of Dionysius is one of the
most remarkable instances of the vicissitudes of fortune
known in history; and what then must we suppose was the
joy and pride of the Syracusans, when they reflected that
with such slender means they had overthrown the most
powerful dynasty at that time existing in the world?</p>
<p>LI.<a id="l51"></a> After Apollokrates had sailed away and Dion had
entered the citadel, the women could endure no longer to
wait indoors till he came to them, but ran to the gates,
Aristomache leading Dion’s son, and Arete following
behind her in tears, and at a loss to know how she should
greet her husband after she had been married to another.
After Dion had embraced his sister and his child,
Aristomache led Arete forward, and said, “Dion, we were
unhappy while you were an exile; but now that you have
returned and conquered you have taken away our reproach
from all but Arete here, whom I have had the misery to
see forced to accept another husband while you were
yet alive. Now, therefore, since fortune has placed us in
your power, how do you propose to settle this difficulty?
Is she to embrace you as her uncle or as her husband
also?” Dion shed tears at these words of Aristomache,
and affectionately embraced his wife. He placed his son
in her hands, and bade her go to his own house, where he
himself also continued to live; for he delivered up the
citadel to the people of Syracuse.</p>
<p>LII.<a id="l52"></a> After he had thus accomplished his enterprise, he
reaped no advantage from his success, except that he conferred
favours on his friends and rewarded his allies;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
while he bestowed upon his own companions, both Syracusan
and Peloponnesian, such signal marks of his gratitude
that his generosity even outran his means. He
himself continued to live simply and frugally, while not
only Sicily and Carthage, but all Greece viewed with
admiration the manner in which he bore his prosperity,
considering his achievements to be the greatest, and
himself to be the most splendid instance of successful
daring known to that age. He remained as modest in his
dress, his household, and his table, as though he were
still the guest of Plato in the Academy, and not living
among mercenary soldiers, who recompense themselves for
the hardships and dangers of their lives by daily indulgence
in sensual pleasures. Plato wrote a letter to him, in
which he informed him that the eyes of all the world were
fixed upon him; but Plato probably only alluded to one
place in one city, namely the Academy, and meant that the
critics and judges of Dion therein assembled did not admire
his exertions or his victory, but only considered whether
he bore himself discreetly and modestly in his success,
and showed moderation now that he was all-powerful,
Dion made a point of maintaining the same haughty demeanour
in society, and of treating the people with the
same severity as before, although the times demanded
that he should unbend, and though Plato, as we have
said before, wrote to him bidding him remember that an
arrogant temper is the consort of a lonely life. However,
Dion appears to have been naturally inclined to harshness,
and besides was desirous of reforming the manners of the
Syracusans, who were excessively licentious and corrupt.</p>
<p>LIII.<a id="l53"></a> Now Herakleides again opposed him. When
Dion sent for him to attend at the council, he refused to
come, declaring that he was a mere private man, and
would go only to the public assembly with the other
citizens. Next he reproached Dion for not having demolished
the citadel, for having restrained the people when
they wished to break open the tomb of Dionysius (the
elder) and cast out his body, and for having insulted his
own fellow-countrymen by sending to Corinth for counsellors
and colleagues. Indeed, Dion had sent to Corinth
for some commissioners from that city, hoping that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>their
presence would assist him in effecting the reforms which
he meditated. Like Plato, he regarded a pure democracy
as not being a government at all, but rather a warehouse
of all forms of government: and his intention was to
establish a constitution, somewhat on the Lacedæmonian
or Cretan model, by a judicious combination of monarchy
and oligarchy: and he saw that the government of Corinth
was more of an oligarchy than a democracy, and that few
important measures were submitted to the people. As
Dion expected that Herakleides would most vehemently
oppose these projects, and was moreover a turbulent, fickle,
and facetious personage, he gave him up to those who had
long before desired to kill him, but whom he had formerly
restrained from doing so. These men broke into the house
of Herakleides and killed him. The Syracusans were
deeply grieved at his death; yet, as Dion gave him a
splendid funeral, followed the corpse at the head of his
army, and afterwards made a speech to the people, they
forgave him, reflecting that their city could never have
obtained rest while Dion and Herakleides were both
engaged in political life.</p>
<p>LIV.<a id="l54"></a> One of Dion’s companions was an Athenian named
Kallippus, who, we are told by Plato, became intimate with
him, not because of his learning, but because he happened
to have initiated Dion into some religious mysteries.
This man took part in Dion’s expedition, and received
especial honours, being the first of all Dion’s comrades
who marched into Syracuse with him, wearing a garland
on his head, and he had always distinguished himself in
the combats which took place since that time. Now,
seeing that the noblest and best of Dion’s friends had
fallen in the war, and that by the death of Herakleides the
Syracusan people were deprived of their leader, while he
had greater influence than any one else with Dion’s
mercenary soldiers, Kallippus conceived a scheme of detestable
villainy. No doubt he hoped to obtain the whole of
Sicily as his reward for murdering Dion, though some
writers state that he received a bribe of twenty talents
from Dion’s personal enemies. He now drew several of
the mercenary soldiers into a conspiracy against Dion,
conducting his plot in a most ingenious and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>treacherous
manner. He was in the habit of informing Dion of any
treasonable speeches, whether true or invented by himself,
which he said that he had heard from the mercenary troops,
and by this means gained such entire confidence with him,
that he was able to hold secret meetings and plot against
Dion with whichever of the soldiers he pleased, having
Dion’s express command to do so, in order that none of the
disaffected party might escape his notice. By this means
Kallippus was easily enabled to find out all the worst and
most discontented of the mercenaries, and to organise a
conspiracy amongst them; while, if any man refused to
listen to his proposals and denounced him to Dion, he took
no heed of it and showed no anger, believing that Kallippus
was merely carrying out his own instructions.</p>
<p>LV.<a id="l55"></a> When the plot was formed, Dion beheld a great
and portentous vision. Late in the evening he was sitting
alone in the hall<a id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_495_495">495</a> of his house, plunged in thought. Suddenly
he heard a noise on the other side of the court, and,
looking up, as it was not quite dark, saw a tall woman,
with the face and dress of a Fury as represented upon the
stage, sweeping the house with a kind of broom. He was
terribly startled, and became so much alarmed that he
sent for his friends, described the vision to them, and besought
them to remain with him during the night, as he
was beside himself with fright, and dreaded lest if he
were alone the apparition might return. This, however,
did not take place. A few days after this his son, now
almost grown up, took offence at some trifling affront, and
destroyed himself by throwing himself headlong from the
roof of the house.</p>
<p>LVI.<a id="l56"></a> While Dion was thus alarmed and distressed, Kallippus
all the more eagerly carried out his plot. He spread
a rumour among the Syracusans that Dion, being childless,
had determined to recall Apollokrates, the son of Dionysius,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
and to make him his heir, since he was his wife’s
nephew, and his sister’s grandson. By this time Dion
and the women of his household began to entertain some
suspicion of the plot, and information of it reached them
from all quarters. Dion, however, grieved at the murder
of Herakleides, as though that crime had stained his glory,
had become low-spirited and miserable, and frequently
said that he was willing to die, and would let any man
cut his throat, if he were obliged to live amidst constant
precautions against his friends as well as his enemies.
Kallippus, who perceived that the women had discovered
the whole plot, came to them in great alarm, denying that
he had any share in it, shedding tears, and offering to give
any pledge of his loyalty which they chose to ask for.
They demanded that he should swear the great oath,
which is as follows:—The person who is about to swear
enters the precinct of the temple of Demeter and Persephone,
and after certain religious ceremonies puts on the
purple robe of the goddess Persephone, and swears, holding
a lighted torch in his hand. All this was done by
Kallippus, and after swearing the oath he was impious
enough to wait for the festival of the goddess whose name
he had taken in vain, and to commit the murder on the
day which was specially dedicated to her, although, perhaps,
he thought nothing about the profanation of that particular
day, but considered that it would be wickedness enough
to murder the man whom he had himself initiated into
the mysteries, on whatever day he might do it.</p>
<p>LVII.<a id="l57"></a> Many were now in the plot; and when Dion was
sitting with his friends in a room furnished with several
couches, some of the conspirators surrounded the house,
while others stood at the doors and windows. Those who
intended to do the deed were Zakynthians, and entered
the house in their tunics, without swords. Those who
remained outside made fast the doors, while those within
rushed upon Dion, and endeavoured to strangle him. As,
however, they could not accomplish this, they asked for a
sword; but no one ventured to open the doors, because
within the house were many of Dion’s friends, but as
each of these imagined that, if he gave up Dion, he
himself might get away safe, no one would help him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
After some delay, a Syracusan, named Lykon, handed
a dagger through a window to the Zakynthians, with
which, as if sacrificing a victim, they cut the throat of
Dion, who had long before been overpowered and had
given himself up for lost. His sister and his wife, who
was pregnant, were at once cast into prison, where the
unhappy woman was delivered of a male child. The
women prevailed upon the keepers of the prison to spare
the child’s life, and obtained their request the more readily
because Kallippus was already in difficulties.</p>
<p>LVIII.<a id="l58"></a> After Kallippus had murdered Dion, he at once
became a person of importance, and had the entire government
of Syracuse in his hands. He even sent despatches
to Athens, a city which, next to the gods, he ought, especially
to have dreaded, after having brought such pollution
and sacrilege upon himself. However, the saying
appears to be true, that that city produces both the best
of good and the worst of wicked men, just as the territory
of Athens produces both the sweetest honey and the most
poisonous hemlock. Kallippus did not long survive to
mock the justice of heaven, lest the gods might have been
thought to disregard a man who, by such a crime, had
obtained so great wealth and power; but he soon paid the
penalty of his wickedness. He set out to capture Katana,
and in doing so lost Syracuse; upon which he is said to
have remarked, that he had lost a city and gained a
cheese-scraper. In an attack upon Messenia he lost most
of his soldiers, among whom were the murderers of Dion.
As no city in Sicily would receive him, but all hated him
and attacked him, he proceeded to Rhegium, where, as
he was quite ruined and could no longer maintain his
mercenary soldiers, he was murdered by Leptines and
Polyperchon, who chanced to use the self-same dagger
with which Dion is said to have been slain. It was recognised
by being very short, after the Laconian fashion, and
by its workmanship, for it was admirably carved with
figures in high relief. Such was the retribution which
befel Kallippus; while Aristomache and Arete, when they
were released from prison, fell into the power of Hiketes,
a Syracusan, who had been one of Dion’s friends, and who
treated them at first loyally and honourably, but afterwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>
at the instigation of some of the enemies of Dion,
sent them on board of a ship, on the pretext of sending
them to Peloponnesus, and gave orders to the people of
the ship to put them to death and throw their bodies into
the sea. They, however, are said to have thrown them
alive into the sea, and the child with them. This man
also paid a fitting penalty for his crimes, for he was taken
and put to death by Timoleon, and the Syracusans put to
death his two daughters to avenge the murder of Dion.
All of this I have already described at length in the Life
of Timoleon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF BRUTUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="m1"></a> The ancestor of Marcus Brutus was Junius Brutus,<a id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_496_496">496</a>
whose statue of bronze the Romans of old set up in the
Capitol, in the midst of the kings, with a drawn sword in
his hand, thereby signifying that it was he who completely
accomplished the putting down of the Tarquinii. Now
that Brutus, like swords forged of cold iron, having a
temper naturally hard and not softened by education, was
carried on even to slaying of his sons through his passion
against the tyrants: but this Brutus, about whom I am
now writing, having tempered his natural disposition with
discipline and philosophical training and roused his earnest
and mild character by impulse to action, is considered to
have been most aptly fashioned to virtue, so that even
those who were his enemies on account of the conspiracy
against Cæsar, attributed to Brutus whatever of good the
act brought with it, and the worst of what happened they
imputed to Cassius, who was a kinsman and friend of
Brutus, but in his disposition not so simple and pure.
His mother Servilia<a id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_497_497">497</a> traced her descent from Ala
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>Servilius,<a id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_498_498">498</a> who when Mallius Spurius was contriving to
establish a tyranny and was stirring up the people, put a
dagger under his arm, and going into the Forum and taking
his stand close to the man, as if he were going to have
something to do with him and to address him, struck him
as he bent forwards and killed him. Now this is agreed
on; but those who showed hatred and enmity towards
Brutus on account of Cæsar’s death, say that on the father’s
side he was not descended from the expeller of the
Tarquinii, for that Brutus after putting his sons to death
left no descendants, but this Brutus was a plebeian, the son
of one Brutus who was a bailiff,<a id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_499_499">499</a> and had only recently
attained to a magistracy. Poseidonius the philosopher says
that the sons of Brutus, who had arrived at man’s estate,
were put to death as the story is told, but there was left a
third, an infant, from whom the race of Brutus descended;
and that some of the illustrious men of his time who belonged
to the family showed a personal resemblance to the
statue of Brutus. So much about this.</p>
<p>II.<a id="m2"></a> Servilia the mother of Brutus was a sister of Cato
the philosopher, whom most of all the Romans this Brutus
took for his model, Cato being his uncle and afterwards
his father-in-law. As to the Greek philosophers, there
was not one, so to say, whom he did not hear or to whom
he was averse, but he devoted himself especially to those
of Plato’s school. The Academy<a id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_500_500">500</a> called the New and the
Middle he was not much disposed to, and he attached
himself to the Old, and continued to be an admirer of
Antiochus<a id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_501_501">501</a> of Ascalon; but for his friend and companion he
chose Antiochus’s brother Aristus, a man who in his manner
of discourse was inferior to many philosophers, but in well-regulated
habits and mildness a rival to the first.
Empylus,<a id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_502_502">502</a> whom both Brutus in his letters and his friends
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>often mentioned as being in intimacy with him, was a
rhetorician and left a small work, though not a mean one,
on the assassination of Cæsar, which is inscribed Brutus.
In the Latin language Brutus was sufficiently trained for
oratory<a id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_503_503">503</a> and the contests of the forum; but in the Greek,
he practised the apophthegmatic and Laconic brevity
which is sometimes conspicuous in his letters. For
instance when he was now engaged in the war, he wrote
to the people of Pergamum: “I hear that you have given
money to Dolabella; if you gave it willingly, you admit
your wrong; if you gave it unwillingly, make proof of
this by giving to me willingly!” On another occasion, to
the Samians: “Your counsels are trifling; your help is
slow. What end do you expect of this?” And another
about the people of Patara: “The Xanthians by rejecting
my favours have made their country the tomb of their
desperation. The people of Patara by trusting to me want
nothing of liberty in the management of their affairs. It
is therefore in your power also to choose the decision of the
people of Patara or the fortune of the Xanthians.” Such
is the character of the most remarkable of his letters.</p>
<p>III.<a id="m3"></a> While he was still a youth he went abroad with
his uncle Cato, who was sent to Cyprus<a id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_504_504">504</a> to Ptolemæus.
After Ptolemæus had put an end to himself, Cato, being
detained of necessity in Rhodes, happened to have sent
Canidius, one of his friends, to look after the money, but as
he feared that Canidius would not keep his hands from
filching, he wrote to Brutus to sail as quick as he could to
Cyprus from Pamphylia; for Brutus was staying there to
recover from an illness. Brutus sailed very much against
his will, both out of respect for Canidius, as being undeservedly
deprived of his functions by Cato, and inasmuch
as he was a young man and a student,<a id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_505_505">505</a> considering
such a piece of business and administration not at all
fit for a free man or for himself. However, he exerted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>himself about these matters and was commended by Cato;
and when the king’s substance was converted into money,
he took the greatest part and sailed to Rome.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="m4"></a> But when matters came to a division, Pompeius and
Cæsar having taken up arms, and the government being
in confusion, it was expected that he would choose Cæsar’s
side, for his father<a id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_506_506">506</a> was put to death by Pompeius some
time before; but as he thought it right to prefer the
public interests to his own, and as he considered the ground
of Pompeius for the war to be better than Cæsar’s, he
joined Pompeius. And yet, hitherto, when he met
Pompeius, he would not even speak to him, thinking it a
great crime to talk with his father’s murderer; but now,
placing himself under Pompeius as leader of his country,
he sailed to Sicily as legatus with Sestius,<a id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_507_507">507</a> who had got it
for his province. But as there was nothing of importance
to do there, and Pompeius and Cæsar had already met
together to contend for the supremacy, he went to
Macedonia as a volunteer to share the danger; on which
occasion they say that Pompeius, being delighted and
surprised at his coming, rose from his seat and embraced
him as a superior man in the presence of all. During the
campaign all the daytime when he was not with Pompeius
he was employed about study and books; and not only at
other times, but also before the great battle. It was the
height of summer, and the heat was excessive, as they were
encamped close to marshy ground; and those who carried
the tent of Brutus did not come quickly. After being
much harassed about these matters, and having scarcely by
midday anointed himself and taken a little to eat, while
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>the rest were either sleeping or engaged in thought and
care about the future, he kept on writing till evening-time,
making an epitome of Polybius.<a id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_508_508">508</a></p>
<p>V.<a id="m5"></a> It is said that Cæsar, too, was not indifferent about
the man, but gave orders to those who commanded under
him not to kill Brutus in the battle, but to spare him;
find if he yielded to bring him, and if he resisted being
taken, to let him alone and not force him; and this, it is
said, he did to please Servilia,<a id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_509_509">509</a> the mother of Brutus.
For when he was still a youth, he had, it seems, known
Servilia, who was passionately in love with him, and as
Brutus was born about the time when her love was most
ardent, he had in some degree a persuasion that Brutus
was his son. It is recorded that when the great affair of
Catilina had engaged the Senate, which affair came very
near overturning the State, Cato and Cæsar were standing
up at the same time and disputing. While this was going
on, a small letter was brought in and given to Cæsar,
which he read silently, whereon Cato called out that
Cæsar was doing a shameful thing in receiving communications
and letters from their enemies. Many of the
Senators hereon made a tumult, and Cæsar gave the letter
just as it was to Cato, and it was a passionate letter from
his sister Servilia, which he read and throwing it to Cæsar
said, “Take it, drunkard;” and he again turned afresh to
his argument and his speech. So notorious was the love
of Servilia for Cæsar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>
<p>VI.<a id="m6"></a> After the defeat at Pharsalus and the escape of
Pompeius to the sea, while the ramparts were blockaded,
Brutus secretly got out of the gates which led to a marshy
spot, full of water and reeds, and made his way by night
to Larissa. From thence he wrote to Cæsar, who was
pleased that he was alive and told him to come to him;
and he not only pardoned Brutus, but had him about him
and treated him with as much respect as any one else.
No one could say where Pompeius had fled to, and there
was much doubt about it; but Cæsar walking a short
way alone with Brutus tried to find out his opinion on
the matter; and as Brutus appeared, from certain considerations,
to have come to the best conjecture about the
flight of Pompeius, Cæsar leaving everything else hurried
to Egypt. But Pompeius, who, as Brutus conjectured, had
landed in Egypt, met his fate there; and Brutus mollified
Cæsar even towards Cassius.<a id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_510_510">510</a> When Brutus was speaking
in defence of the King of the Libyans,<a id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_511_511">511</a> he felt himself
overpowered by the magnitude of the charges against him,
but yet by his prayers and urgent entreaties he preserved
for him a large part of his dommions. Cæsar is said,
when he first heard Brutus speaking, to have remarked to
his friends: “This youth, I know not what he wills, but
what he does will, he wills with energy.” For the earnest
character of Brutus, and his disposition not to listen unadvisedly
nor to every one who asked a favour, but to act
upon reflection and principle, made his efforts strong and
effective towards accomplishing whatever he turned to.
But towards unreasonable prayers he was immovable by
flattery, and to be overcome by those who impudently
urged their suit, which some call to be shamed out of a
thing, he considered to be most disgraceful to a great man,
and he was wont to say that those who can refuse nothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>were in his opinion persons who had not well husbanded
their youthful bloom. When Cæsar was going to cross
over to Libya against Cato and Scipio, he intrusted Brutus
with Gallia<a id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_512_512">512</a> on this side of the Alps, to the great good
fortune of the province; for while the other provinces,
through the violence and rapacity of those who were
intrusted with them, were harassed like conquered countries,
Brutus was to the Gauls a relief and consolation for
their former misfortunes; and he put all to Cæsar’s credit,
so that when after his return Cæsar was going about Italy,
the cities that had been under Brutus were a most pleasing
sight, as well as Brutus himself, who was increasing his
honour and associating with him as a friend.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="m7"></a> Now there were several prætorships, but that
which conferred the chief dignity, and is called the Urban
prætorship,<a id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_513_513">513</a> it was expected that either Brutus or Cassius
would have; and some say that Brutus and Cassius, who
had before some slight causes of dispute, were still more
at variance about this office, though they were kinsmen,
for Cassius was the husband of Junia, the sister of Brutus.
Others say that this rivalry was the work of Cæsar, who
continued secretly to give both of them hopes, until, being
thus urged on and irritated, they were brought into
collision. Brutus relied on his good fame and virtues
against the many splendid exploits of Cassius in his
Parthian campaigns. Cæsar hearing this and consulting
with his friends said: “What Cassius says has more
justice, but Brutus must have the first office.” Cassius
was appointed to another prætorship, but he had not so
much gratitude for what he got, as anger for what he
failed in getting. Brutus also shared Cæsar’s power in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>other respects as much as he chose. For if he had chosen,
he might have been the first of his friends and had most
power; but his intimacy with Cassius drew him that way
and turned him from Cæsar, though he had not yet been
reconciled to Cassius after their former rivalry; but he
listened to his friends who urged him not to let himself
be softened and soothed by Cæsar, and to fly from the
friendly advances and the favours which a tyrant showed
him, not because he respected the virtues of Brutus, but
because he wished to curtail his vigour and to undermine
his spirit.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="m8"></a> Nor yet was Cæsar altogether without suspicions
of Brutus, and matter of complaint against him; he feared
the proud temper and the credit and friends of the man,
but he trusted in his moral character. In the first place,
when Antonius and Dolabella<a id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_514_514">514</a> were said to be aiming at
change, he said, it was not sleek and long-haired men who
gave him trouble, but those pale and lean fellows, meaning
Brutus and Cassius. Next, when some persons were
making insinuations against the fidelity of Brutus and
urging Cæsar to be on his guard, he touched his body with
his hand and said, “What, think you that Brutus would
not wait for this poor body?” thereby intimating that
no person but Brutus had any pretensions to so much
power after himself. And indeed it seems that Brutus
might certainly have been the first man in the State, if he
could have endured for a short time to be second to Cæsar,
and if he had let Cæsar’s power pass its acme, and the
fame got by his great exploits waste away. But Cassius,
who was a violent-tempered man and rather on his individual
account a hater of Cæsar than on the public account
a hater of the tyrant, inflamed Brutus and urged him on.
Brutus indeed is said to have been discontented with the
dominion, but Cassius to have hated the dominator; and
Cassius had various grievances against Cæsar and among
others, the seizing of the lions, which Cassius had procured
when he was going to be ædile, but Cæsar kept them after
they had been found in Megara at the time when the city
was taken by Calenus.<a id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_515_515">515</a> It is said that these beasts were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>the cause of great calamity to the people of Megara: for
when the enemy were getting possession of the city, the
citizens forced open their dens and loosed their chains,
that the beasts might oppose the enemy who were entering
the city, but they rushed against the citizens themselves,
and running among them rent those who were unarmed,
so that the sight moved even the enemy to pity.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="m9"></a> Now they say that this was with Cassius the main
cause of his conspiring; but they say so untruly. For
there was from the beginning in the nature of Cassius a
certain hostility and dislike to all the race of tyrants, as
he showed when he was still a boy and went to the same
school with Faustus,<a id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_516_516">516</a> the son of Sulla. Faustus was one
day bragging among the boys and exalting the monarchy
of his father, on which Cassius got up and thumped him.
The guardians of Faustus and his kinsmen were desirous
to prosecute the matter and seek legal satisfaction; but
Pompeius prevented this, and bringing both the boys
together questioned them about the affair. Thereon it is
reported that Cassius said, “Come, now, Faustus, say if
you dare before Pompeius the words at which I was enraged,
that I may break your mouth again.” Such was the
character of Cassius. But many words from his friends
and many oral and written expressions from the citizens
called and urged Brutus to the deed. For they wrote on
the statue of his ancestor Brutus, who had put down the
dominion of the kings: “Would you were here, Brutus!”
and “Would Brutus were now living!” And the tribunal
of Brutus, who was prætor, was found every morning full
of such writings as these: “Brutus, are you asleep?” and
“You are not really Brutus!” But they who were the
real cause of this were the flatterers of Cæsar, who devised
various unpopular distinctions for him and placed diadems
on his statues by night, as if their design was to lead on
the many to salute him as king instead of dictator. But
the contrary was the result, as it has been circumstantially
told in the Life of Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_517_517">517</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>
<p>X.<a id="m10"></a> When Cassius was trying to move his friends
against Cæsar, they all assented, provided Brutus would
take the lead; for they said that the undertaking required
not hands nor yet daring, but the character of a man such
as Brutus was, who should as it were begin the holy rite
and confirm it by his presence: if this could not be, the
conspirators would be more dispirited in the doing of the
deed and more timid when they had done it, for it would
be said that Brutus would not have rejected all share in
the thing, if it had a good cause. Cassius, who saw the
truth of this, now made the first advances to Brutus since
their difference. And after their reconciliation and friendly
greeting Cassius asked, if he intended to be present in the
Senate on the new-moon of March, for he heard that Cæsar’s
friends would then make a proposal about the kingly power.
Brutus replied that he would not be present. “What then,”
said Cassius, “if they summon us?” “It would be my
business then,” said Brutus, “not to be silent, but to fight
and die in defence of liberty.” Cassius being now encouraged
said, “What Roman will endure that you die
first? Brutus, do you not know yourself? Do you think it is
the weavers and tavern-keepers who have written on your
tribunal, and not the first and best who have done this,
and who demand from the other prætors donations and
shows and gladiators, but from you, as a debt that you owe
your country, the destruction of the tyranny, and who are
ready to suffer everything for you, if you show yourself to
be such a man as they think you ought to be and they expect
you to be.” Upon this he threw his arms around Brutus
and embraced him, and thus separating each went to his
friends.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="m11"></a> There was one Caius Ligarius,<a id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_518_518">518</a> a friend of Pompeius,
who had been accused on this ground and acquitted
by Cæsar. This man, who had not gratitude for his
acquittal of the charge, but was hostile to the power by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>reason of which he had been in danger, was an enemy of
Cæsar, and one of the most intimate friends of Brutus.
Brutus, who came to see him when he was sick, said,
“Ligarius, at what a time you are sick!” Immediately
supporting himself on his elbow, and laying hold of the
hand of Brutus, Ligarius said, “But if you, Brutus, design
anything worthy of yourself, I am well.”</p>
<p>XII.<a id="m12"></a> After this they secretly sounded their acquaintance
whom they trusted, and communicated the design to
them, and added them to their number; making choice
not only among their intimates, but those whom they
knew to be good darers and to despise death. It was for
this reason that they concealed their design from Cicero,
though both as to trustworthiness and goodwill he was
esteemed by them among the first, lest to his natural
defect of courage he should join by reason of his years
senile caution, and so attempting by deliberation to bring
everything singly to perfect security, should blunt their
edge, which required the speed of ready action. Among
his other companions Brutus omitted also Statilius<a id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_519_519">519</a> the
Epicurean, and Favonius, an admirer of Cato, because
when Brutus, in conversation and philosophical disquisition,
had remotely and in a circuitous way sounded them
about such an attempt, Favonius answered that a civil war
was worse than an illegal monarchy; and Statilius said
that it was not befitting a wise man, and one who had
understanding, to expose himself to danger and to trouble
on account of the vile and foolish. Labeo,<a id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_520_520">520</a> who was present,
opposed both of them. Brutus, indeed, at the time
kept silent, as if he considered that the matter was something
hard and difficult to determine; but afterwards he
communicated his design to Labeo. When Labeo had
readily accepted the proposal, it was resolved to gain over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>the other Brutus, surnamed Albinus,<a id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_521_521">521</a> who was not a man
of action, nor courageous, but he was strengthened by a
number of gladiators, whom he was keeping for a spectacle
for the Romans, and he was also in the confidence of Cæsar.
When Cassius and Labeo spoke to him he made no answer,
but meeting privately with Brutus, and learning that he
was the leader in the act, he agreed to co-operate zealously.
The greater part, and the men of chief note among the
rest of the conspirators, were also brought over by the
reputation of Brutus. And without swearing any mutual
oath, or taking or giving mutual pledges by sacrifice of
victims, they all so kept the secret in themselves and were
silent and carried it with them, that the act, though prognosticated
by the gods through oracular answers and sights
and victims, was considered past belief.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="m13"></a> Brutus having now the first men in Rome, both
for spirit and family and virtues, dependent upon himself,
and having a view of the whole danger, in his public
demeanour endeavoured to restrain within himself and to
keep his designs under strict control; but at home and by
night he was no longer the same man, for sometimes care
roused him involuntarily from his sleep, and at other times
he was sunk in thought and brooding over the difficulties;
and it did not escape his wife, who was resting with him,
that he was full of unusual trouble, and was revolving in
himself some design hard to carry and difficult to unravel.
Now Porcia,<a id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_522_522">522</a> as it has been said, was the daughter of
Cato, and Brutus, who was her cousin, had married her,
not in her virgin state, but he took her after the death of
her husband, while she was still a young woman, and had
one little child by her husband, and the child’s name was
Bibulus; and there is extant a small book of memoirs of
Brutus, written by Bibulus. Porcia, who was a philosopher
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
and loved her husband, and was full of spirit and
good sense, did not attempt to question her husband about
his secrets before she had made trial of herself in manner
following. She took a knife, such as barbers pare the
nails with, and putting all her attendants out of the chamber,
she inflicted a deep wound in her thigh, so that there
was a large flow of blood, and, shortly after, violent pains
and shivering fever came upon her in consequence of the
wound. Brutus being agonised and full of trouble, Porcia
spoke to him thus in the acme of her pain: “I, Brutus,
Cato’s daughter, was given unto thy house, not like women,
who serve as concubines, to share thy bed and board only,
but to be a partner in thy happiness, and a partner in thy
sorrows. Now, with respect to thy marriage, everything
is blameless on thy part; but as to me, what evidence is
there, or what affection, if I must neither share with thee
a secret sorrow nor a care which demands confidence? I
know that a woman’s nature is considered too weak to
carry a secret, but, Brutus, there is a certain power towards
making moral character in a good nurture and
honest conversation; and I am Cato’s daughter and also
Brutus’ wife, whereon hitherto I had less relied, but now
I know that I am also invincible to pain.” Thus saying,
she showed him the wound, and told him of the trial she
had made of herself. Struck with astonishment and stretching
forth his hands, Brutus prayed that the gods would
permit him to succeed in the enterprise and to show himself
a husband worthy of Porcia. He then consoled his wife.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="m14"></a> When notice had been given of a meeting of the
Senate, at which Cæsar was expected to be present, they
resolved to make the attempt, for they would be then
collected without raising any suspicion, and they would
have together all the men of highest character and rank,
who would be ready as soon as a great act was accomplished,
forthwith to seize their freedom. The circumstance
of the place, too, was considered to be a token from
heaven and in their favour. For it was a portico, one
belonging to the theatre,<a id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_523_523">523</a> with an exhedra, in which
there was a statue of Pompeius, which the city erected at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>the time when Pompeius adorned that site with porticoes
and the theatre. Hither then the Senate was summoned
about the middle of the month of March; the Romans call
the day the Ides; so that some dæmon seemed to be
bringing the man to the vengeance of Pompeius. When
the day came, Brutus put a dagger under his vest, without
any one being privy to it except his wife, and went forth;
the rest assembled at the house of Cassius, to conduct
down to the Forum Cassius’ son, who was going to assume
the toga called virilis. From thence they all hurried to
the portico of Pompeius, where they waited in expectation
of Cæsar’s coming immediately to the Senate. Herein
most of all would one have admired the impassiveness of
the men and their presence of mind before the danger, if
he had known what was going to take place—in that, being
compelled by their duties of prætor to attend to the concerns
of many persons, they not only listened patiently to
those who came before them and had matter in dispute,
like men who have plenty of leisure, but they also gave
to each their decision in exact form and with judgment,
carefully attending to the business. And when one person,
who was unwilling to submit to the decision, was appealing
to Cæsar, and calling out loud and protesting, Brutus,
looking on the bystanders, said: “Cæsar does not hinder
me from acting according to the laws, and he will not
hinder me.”</p>
<p>XV.<a id="m15"></a> And yet many things chanced to fall out to cause
them perplexity; first and chief, that Cæsar tarried while
the day was getting on, and as the victims were not
propitious, was kept at home by his wife, and was hindered
by the priests from going abroad. In the next place, a
person came up to Casca, who was one of the conspirators,
and taking his hand said, “Casca, you have concealed the
secret from us, but Brutus has disclosed all to me.” Casca
was startled at this, whereon the other smiled and said,
“How have you grown so rich all at once as to become a
candidate for the ædileship?” So near did Casca come to
betraying the secret, being deceived by the ambiguity of
the man’s words. A senator also, Popilius Lænas,<a id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_524_524">524</a> saluted
Brutus and Cassius in a more lively way than usual, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>whispering in a low tone, “You have my wishes,” he said,
“for success in what you design, and I urge you not to tarry,
for the matter is no secret.” Saying this he withdrew,
putting them in great suspicion of the intended deed being
known. In the meantime one came running from the
house of Brutus and told him that his wife was dying.
For Porcia, who was beside herself through thinking of
what was going to be done, and unable to bear the weight
of her anxiety, could scarce keep herself within doors, and
at every noise and shout, like those possessed with bacchic
frenzy, she would spring forth and question every one
who came in from the Forum, what Brutus was doing,
and was continually sending others out. At length, as
the time began to be protracted, her bodily strength no
longer held out, but she fainted and swooned away, her
mind wandering by reason of her perplexity; and she
could not reach her apartment before faintness and indescribable
alarm seized her, where she was sitting in the
midst of her attendants, and her colour changed and her
voice was completely choked. Her maids at this sight
shrieked aloud, and as the neighbours quickly ran to the
door, a report went forth and was given out abroad, that
she was dead. However she quickly recovered and was
herself again, and her women took care of her. Brutus
was troubled, as was natural, by this report coming upon
him; yet he did not desert the public interest, nor allow
himself to be carried away by his feelings to his own
domestic affairs.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="m16"></a> And now it was told that Cæsar was approaching,
borne in a litter. For he had determined, in consequence
of being dispirited by the sacrifices, to ratify nothing of
importance at that time, but to put things off on the
pretext of illness. When he had stepped out of the litter,
Popilius Lænas hurried up to him, he who had a little
before wished Brutus good luck and success, and he talked
some time with Cæsar who was standing there and listening.
The conspirators (for so we may call them) not hearing
what he said, but conjecturing from their own suspicions
that the conversation was a discovery of the plot, sunk in
their spirits and looked at one another, by their countenances
declaring to one another that they ought not to wait to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>be
seized, but forthwith to die by their own hands. Cassius
and some others had already laid their hands on the hilts
of their daggers under their garments and were drawing
them out, when Brutus observing in the attitude of Lænas
the earnestness of a man who was asking a favour and
not preferring an accusation, said nothing, because so many
persons not of their party were mingled with them, but
he encouraged Cassius by the cheering expression of
his countenance. And soon after Lænas kissed Cæsar’s
right hand and withdrew, by which it was plain that he
had spoken with Cæsar about himself and some of his own
concerns.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="m17"></a><a id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_525_525">525</a> The Senate having advanced to the exhedra, the
conspirators surrounded Cæsar’s chair, as if they designed
to have a conference with him. And it is said that Cassius,
turning his face to the statue of Pompeius, invoked him as
if he could hear; and Trebonius having engaged Antonius
in conversation at the door kept him out. As Cæsar
entered, the Senate stood up, and as soon as he sat down,
the conspirators in a body surrounded him, putting forward
Tillius Cimber, one of their number, to supplicate for his
brother who was an exile; and they all joined in the supplication,
laying hold of Cæsar’s hands, and they kissed
his breast and head. Cæsar at first repulsed their intreaties,
and then, as they did not intermit, he made a sudden
attempt to rise up, on which Tillius, with both his hands,
pulled Cæsar’s garment down from the shoulders, and
Casca first of all (for he stood behind him) drew his sword
and drove it into Cæsar’s body near the shoulders, but to
no great depth. Cæsar, laying hold of the handle, cried
out aloud in the Roman language, “Villain Casca, what
are you doing!” and Casca, addressing his brother in Greek,
urged him to come to his aid. Cæsar being now assaulted
by many, looked around with the intention of forcing his
way through them, but when he saw Brutus drawing his
sword against him, he let loose his hold of Casca’s hand,
and wrapping his head in his garment he offered his body
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>to the blows. The conspirators, who were all mingled in
confusion, and using their numerous swords against Cæsar,
wounded one another, so that even Brutus received a blow
on the hand while he was taking part in the slaughter;
and they were all drenched with blood.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="m18"></a> Cæsar having been thus killed, Brutus advanced
into the midst wishing to speak, and he attempted to
detain the Senate by encouraging them; but the senators,
through fear, fled in disorder, and there was shoving and
confusion about the door, though no one pursued or pressed
upon them. For it had been firmly resolved to kill no
other than Cæsar, but to invite all to freedom. Now the
rest, when they were deliberating about the deed, were of
opinion that they should kill Antonius at the same time
with Cæsar, as he was a man who aspired to monarchical
power and was a violent man, and had got strength by his
intercourse and familiarity with the army; and chiefly
that to his natural haughtiness and daring temper he had
added the dignity of the consulship, being then Cæsar’s
colleague. But Brutus opposed the design, first relying
on grounds of justice, and next suggesting hopes of a
change. For he did not despair that Antonius, a man of
generous nature, a lover of honourable distinctions and
fond of fame, when Cæsar was put out of the way, would
join his country in seizing hold of freedom, and be led on
by them through emulation to what was good. In this
way Brutus saved Antonius; but in the then alarm
Antonius changed his dress for plebeian attire and fled.
Brutus and his partisans went to the Capitol, their hands
stained with blood, and displaying their bare swords called
the citizens to liberty. Now, at first, there were shouts, and
the people running this way and that, as chance would
have it, after the murder, increased the confusion; but as
there was no more slaughter and no plundering of the
things exposed for sale, both the senators and many of the
plebeians took heart and went up to the conspirators
to the Capitol. The multitude being assembled, Brutus
spoke in a way to please the people and suitable to the circumstances;
and as the people commended him and called
out for them to come down, the conspirators confidently
descended to the Forum, the rest following with one another;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
but many of the persons of distinction putting Brutus
in the midst of them, conducted him with great show
from the Capitol, and placed him on the Rostra. At the
sight of this the many, though a mingled body and prepared
to raise a tumult, were afraid, and they awaited the
result in order and silence. When Brutus came forward
they all listened to what he said; but that the deed was
not agreeable to all, they made evident when Cinna began
to speak and to bring charges against Cæsar, by breaking
out in passion and abusing Cinna, so that the conspirators
returned to the Capitol. Brutus, fearing to be blockaded,
then sent away the chief persons of those who had gone
up with him, not thinking it right that, as they had no
share in the blame, they should sustain a share in the
danger.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="m19"></a> However, on the following day when the Senate
met in the temple of Earth, and Antonius and Plancus<a id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_526_526">526</a> and
Cicero had spoken about an amnesty and concord, it was
resolved that the conspirators should not only have impunity,
but that the consuls should also propose a measure
for conferring honours on them. They voted these things,
and then separated. After Antonius had sent his son to
the Capitol as a hostage, Brutus and the conspirators came
down, and there were salutations and pressing of hands
among all of them together. Antonius received Cassius
and feasted him, and Lepidus entertained Brutus; and the
rest were entertained by others according to the intimacy
or friendship that existed between them. At daybreak
the senators met again, and in the first place they conferred
honours on Antonius for having stopped the beginning
of civil wars; in the second place, thanks were given to
Brutus and his friends who were present, and finally distributions
of provinces. For to Brutus they decreed Crete,
and to Cassius Libya, and to Trebonius Asia, and to Cimber
Bithynia, and to the other Brutus Gallia on the Eridanus.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="m20"></a> After this a discussion arising about the will of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>Cæsar and his interment, and Antonius demanding that
the will should be read, and that the body should be carried
forth not secretly nor without due honours, so that this,
too, might not irritate the people, Cassius violently opposed
it, but Brutus gave way, wherein he was considered to
have made a second mistake. For in sparing Antonius
he incurred the imputation of strengthening against the
conspirators a dangerous and irresistible enemy; and as to
the matter of the interment, in allowing it to take place in
the way in which Antonius demanded, he was considered
to have altogether made a mistake. For in the first place
there being given by the will to every Roman seventy-five
drachmæ,<a id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_527_527">527</a> and to the people there being left the gardens
beyond the river, where the temple of Fortuna now is, a
wonderful degree of affection and regret for Cæsar seized
the citizens: in the second place, when the body had been
carried into the Forum, and Antonius according to custom
had pronounced a funeral oration in honour of Cæsar, seeing
that the masses were stirred by his speech, he changed
their feeling into compassion, and taking the blood-stained
vest of Cæsar he unfolded it and showed the rents
and the number of the wounds. Upon this there was no
longer any order kept; but some called out to kill the
murderers, and others, as before in the case of Clodius<a id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_528_528">528</a>
the demagogue, tearing up the benches and tables from the
workshops and bringing them together made a very large
pile; and placing the corpse upon it in the midst of many
temples and asyla and holy places burnt it. When the fire
blazed forth, men from various quarters, approaching and
plucking out half-burnt pieces of wood, ran about to the
houses of Cæsar’s assassins, intending to fire them. But
they were already well prepared and repelled the danger.
Now there was one Cinna,<a id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_529_529">529</a> a man given to poetry, who
was under no imputation in the matter, and had even been
a friend of Cæsar. He dreamed in a dream that he was
invited by Cæsar to supper and he refused; but Cæsar
urged and forced him, and at last, laying hold of his hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>led him to a vast and gloomy place, he following the while
unwilling and alarmed. After having this vision, it happened
that he had a fever in the night. Nevertheless, in
the morning, when Cæsar’s body was being carried forth
he felt ashamed not to be present, and went out to the
rabble, who were now in a ferocious mood. Being seen and
supposed to be not the Cinna that he was, but the Cinna
who had lately reviled Cæsar before the assembly, he was
torn in pieces.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="m21"></a> It was mainly through fear on account of this
unlucky affair, next after the change in Antonius, that
Brutus and his partisans left the city. They stayed in
Antium<a id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_530_530">530</a> at first, with the design of returning to Rome
when the popular fury should have passed its height and
worn itself out. And this they expected to take place as
a matter of course among numbers which were subject to
unsteady and rapid movements, and because they had the
Senate in their favour, who without taking any notice of
those that had torn Cinna to pieces, sought out and seized
those who had attacked the houses of the conspirators.
The people, too, already annoyed at Antonius being nearly
established in monarchical power, longed for Brutus, and
it was expected that he would, in person, superintend the
spectacles<a id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_531_531">531</a> which as prætor it was his duty to exhibit.
But when Brutus heard that many of those who had
served under Cæsar and received lands and cities from him,
were forming designs against him, and were dropping into
the city a few at a time, he did not venture to go, and the
people saw the spectacles, which, though Brutus was absent,
were furnished without any thrift and in a profuse style.
For he had purchased a great number of wild beasts, and he
gave orders that none should be sold or left, but that all
should be killed; and he himself went down to Neapolis
and engaged most of the actors. With respect to a certain
Canutius who was much in favour on the theatre, he wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>to his friends that they should get him on the stage by
persuasion, for it was not fit that any Greek should be
forced. He also wrote to Cicero and urged him by all
means to be present at the spectacles.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="m22"></a> While affairs were in this state, another change
was brought about by the arrival of the young Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_532_532">532</a> He
was the son of Cæsar’s niece, but by Cæsar’s testament he
was left his son and heir: and he was staying at Apollonia
when Cæsar was killed, being engaged with philosophical
studies and waiting for Cæsar, who had resolved to march
forthwith against the Parthians. As soon as he heard of
Cæsar’s death he came to Rome, and by assuming Cæsar’s
name as a mode of beginning to get the popular favour, and
by paying among the citizens the money that was left them,
he made a strong party against Antonius, and by distributing
money he got together and assembled many of those
who had served under Cæsar. Now when Cicero took the
side of Cæsar through hatred of Antonius, Brutus<a id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_533_533">533</a> rebuked
him strongly in his letters, saying that Cicero did not dislike
a master, but feared a master who hated him, and that
his policy was to choose a mild servitude, as he showed by
writing and saying, “How good Cæsar is!” But our fathers,
he said, did not endure even mild masters. He said that
for his part at this crisis he had neither quite resolved to
fight nor to remain quiet, but he was resolved on one thing
only, not to be a slave; but he wondered at Cicero, that
he was afraid of a civil war and one attended with danger,
and was not afraid of a base and inglorious peace, and
that he asked as a reward for ejecting Antonius from the
tyranny, to be allowed to make Cæsar a tyrant.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="m23"></a> Now in his first letters Brutus thus expressed
himself; but when people were separating themselves,
some on the side of Cæsar and some on the side of
Antonius, and the armies being venal were selling themselves
as it were by auction to the highest bidder, Brutus,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>altogether despairing of affairs, resolved to leave Italy, and
he went by land through Lucania to Velia<a id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_534_534">534</a> to the sea.
From this place Porcia, intending to turn back to Rome,
endeavoured to conceal her excessive emotion, but a painting
made her betray herself though she was a noble-spirited
woman. It was a subject from Grecian story,
Hector accompanied by Andromache,<a id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_535_535">535</a> who was receiving
her infant son from Hector and looking upon him. The
sight of the picture, in which her own feelings were
portrayed, melted Porcia to tears, and she went to it many
times in the day and wept. Acilius, one of the friends of
Brutus, having pronounced the words of Andromache to
Hector:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Hector, thou art to me father and mother dear,</div>
<div class="line">And brother too, and husband in thy bloom:”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Brutus, smiling, said, “But it is not for me to say to
Porcia as Hector said:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“‘The loom and distaff, and command the maids;’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>for owing to the natural weakness of her body she is
unable to perform noble deeds equally with us, but in her
mind she nobly dares as we do in defence of our country.”
This is recorded by Bibulus, the son of Porcia.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="m24"></a> Having set out thence Brutus sailed towards
Athens.<a id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_536_536">536</a> The people received him gladly with expressions
of good wishes and public honours, and he lodged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>with a friend. As he attended the discourses of
Theomnestus the Academic, and Cratippus<a id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_537_537">537</a> the Peripatetic,
and associated with those philosophers, it was
supposed that he was altogether inactive and was unbending
himself. But he was busied about preparations
for war, when no one suspected it; for he sent Herostratus
into Macedonia with the view of gaining over those who
were with the armies there, and he attached to himself
and kept with him the young men from Rome who were
residing at Athens for the sake of their studies. Among
them was also a son of Cicero whom Brutus particularly
commends, and says, that whether he is waking or sleeping,
he admires him for his noble disposition and hatred of
tyrants. Having now begun openly to attend to affairs,
and hearing that Roman vessels full of money were sailing
over from Asia, with a commander on board who was an
honest man and an acquaintance of his, he met him near
Carystus;<a id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_538_538">538</a> and having fallen in with him and persuaded
him and obtained a surrender of the vessels, he prepared
for a magnificent entertainment, for it was the birthday
of Brutus. When they had come to drinking and were
pouring out wine with wishes for the success of Brutus
and the liberty of the Romans, Brutus, wishing to encourage
them still more, asked for a larger cup, and taking it up,
without anything moving thereto, he uttered the following
verse:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Me evil fate and Leto’s son<a id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_539_539">539</a> have slain.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>In addition to this they report that when he went out to
fight the last battle at Philippi, Apollo was the word that
he gave to his soldiers. Accordingly they consider that
the utterance of that verse was a sign of what was to
befall him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span></p>
<p>XXV.<a id="m25"></a> After this Antistius gave Brutus fifty ten
thousands out of the money which he was taking to Italy;
and all the soldiers of Pompeius who were still rambling
about Thessaly gladly flocked to Brutus; and he took five
hundred horsemen from Cinna who was conducting them
into Asia to Dolabella.<a id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_540_540">540</a> He then sailed against Demetrias<a id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_541_541">541</a>
and got possession of a large quantity of arms, which were
going to be carried away to Antonius, and had been made
at the command of the elder Cæsar for the Parthian war.
Hortensius,<a id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_542_542">542</a> the governor, also surrendered Macedonia to
him, and the kings and rulers all around began to side
with him and to come over; but in the meantime news
arrived that Caius, the brother of Antonius, had crossed
over from Italy and was marching straight against the
troops which Gabinius<a id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_543_543">543</a> had under him in Epidamnus and
Apollonia. Brutus, intending to anticipate and prevent
him, immediately put in motion those who were with him,
and marched through a difficult country in the midst of a
snow-storm; and he was far in advance of those who conveyed
the provisions. As he came near Epidamnus, he
began to suffer from bulimy<a id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_544_544">544</a> through exhaustion and cold.
This malady chiefly attacks both beasts and men when
they are worn out and in the midst of the snow, whether
it is that the heat owing to the refrigeration and condensation,
when everything is internally compressed, consumes
the nourishment all at once, or that a sharp and subtle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>breath arising from the snow penetrating through, cuts
the body and destroys the warmth which is dispersed outwards
from it. For it seems that heat causes sweats
through meeting with the cold and being quenched about
the surface; whereof there has been further discussion in
another place.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="m26"></a> As Brutus was fainting, and no one in the
army had anything to eat, his attendants were compelled
to fly for refuge to their enemies, and approaching the
gates they asked bread of the watch, who hearing of the
mishap of Brutus came and brought to eat and to drink.
In return for which, when Brutus got possession of the
city, he not only treated them kindly, but also all the
rest for their sake. Caius Antonius now came up to
Apollonia and summoned the soldiers who were there; but
when they went over to Brutus, and he perceived that the
people of Apollonia were in favour of Brutus, he left the
city and marched to Buthrotum.<a id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_545_545">545</a> And in the first place
he lost three cohorts, which were cut to pieces by Brutus
on the march; and in the next place, attempting to force
the posts about Byblis, which were already occupied, he
came to a battle with Cicero and was defeated; for
Brutus employed Cicero in command and gained many
successes through him. Brutus himself came upon Caius,
who was in marshy ground and far separated from the
rest of his troops, but he would not let his men make an
attack, and he threw his cavalry around him with orders
to spare the men, saying that in a short time they would
be theirs; which in fact happened, for they surrendered
themselves and their general, so that there was now a
large force with Brutus. Now Brutus treated Caius
respectfully for some time and did not deprive him of the
insignia of his office, though, as they say, many persons,
and Cicero among the rest, wrote to him from Rome and
urged him to do it. But as Caius began to have secret
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>conferences with the officers and attempted to excite a
mutiny, he had him put in a ship and guarded. The
soldiers who had been corrupted fled to Apollonia and
invited Brutus there, but Brutus said that this was not
the custom among the Romans, and that they must come
to their general, and ask pardon for their offence. They
came, and Brutus pardoned them at their prayer.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="m27"></a> As Brutus was going to set out for Asia, news
arrived of the changes at Rome. The young Caesar had
been strengthened by the Senate against Antonius, whom
he had driven out of Italy, and he was now formidable,
and was seeking for the consulship contrary to law, and
maintaining large armies of which the State had no need.
But when Caesar saw that the Senate was displeased at
this, and was looking abroad towards Brutus and decreeing
provinces<a id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_546_546">546</a> for him and confirming them, he became alarmed.
And he sent to Antonius and invited him to friendship,
and placing his troops around the city he got the consulship,
being yet hardly a young man, but in his twentieth
year, as he said in his Memoirs. He immediately instituted
a prosecution on a charge of murder against Brutus and
his partisans, for having put to death without trial the
first man in the state who was filling the highest offices;
and he named as the accuser of Brutus, Lucius Cornificius,
and Marcus Agrippa as the accuser of Cassius. Accordingly
they were condemned for default of appearance, the
judices being compelled to go to the vote. It is said that
when the crier, according to custom, from the tribunal
summoned Brutus into court, the mass gave a loud groan,
and the nobles bent their heads to the ground and kept
silence; but that Publius Silicius was seen to shed tears,
and for this reason was shortly after one of those who
were proscribed. After this, the three, Cæsar, Antonius
and Lepidus, distributed the provinces among them, and
caused the slaughter and proscription of two hundred men,
among whom Cicero perished.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="m28"></a> When the news of these events reached
Macedonia, Brutus,<a id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_547_547">547</a> compelled by circumstances, wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>to Hortensius to put Caius Antonius to death, on the
ground of avenging Brutus and Cicero, the one being his
friend, and the other both a friend and kinsman. This
was the reason why Antonius, when he afterwards took
Hortensius at Philippi, put him to death on the tomb of
his brother. Brutus says that he felt more shame at the
cause of Cicero’s death than sympathy at his misfortune,
and that he blamed his friends in Rome, for they were
slain more through their own fault than that of the
tyrants, and that they submitted to see and to witness
what it should have been intolerable for them even to
hear. Brutus having taken his army over to Asia, which
was now a considerable force, set about fitting out a naval
force in Bithynia<a id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_548_548">548</a> and in the neighbourhood of Cyzicus;
and himself moving about with his troops settled the
cities and had interviews with the rulers; and he sent to
Cassius<a id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_549_549">549</a> into Syria to recall him from Egypt; for he said
that it was not to get dominion, but to deliver their
country that they were rambling about and collecting a force
with which they would put down the tyrants; that they
ought therefore, remembering and keeping in mind this
purpose, not to hold themselves far from Italy, but to
hasten thither and to aid the citizens. Cassius obeyed, and
Brutus met him on his return; and they fell in with one
another near Smyrna, for the first time since they had
separated in Peiraeus and set out, the one for Syria, the
other for Macedonia. They had accordingly great pleasure
and confidence owing to the force which each had. For
they had hurried from Italy like the most despicable
fugitives, without money and without arms, without a
single ship, a single soldier, or a city, and yet after no
very long interval they had come together with ships and
troops and horses and money, able to struggle for the
supremacy of the Romans.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="m29"></a> Now Cassius was desirous to have and to allow
an equal share of honour, but Brutus herein anticipated
him by generally going to Cassius who, in age, was his
superior, and in body was not able to sustain equal toil.
The opinion was that Cassius was skilled in military
matters, but was violent in passion and governed mainly
by fear, while towards his intimates he was too much
inclined to use ridicule and was too fond of jesting. As
to Brutus, they say that he was esteemed by the many for
his virtues, but loved by his friends, admired by the
nobles, and not hated even by his enemies, because the
man was extraordinarily mild and high-minded and unmoved
by anger, pleasure or love of aggrandisement, and
kept his judgment upright and unbending in the maintenance
of honour and justice. That which got him most
goodwill and reputation was the faith which men had in
his motives. For neither that great Pompeius, if he had
put down Cæsar, was confidently expected to give up his
power to the laws, but to retain affairs in his hands,
pacifying the people with the name of consulship and
dictatorship or some other title with more pleasing name;
and this Cassius, who was a violent and passionate man
and was often carried away from justice in quest of gain,
more than any one else they thought would carry on war,
and ramble about and expose himself to danger for the
purpose of getting power for himself, not liberty for the
citizens. For as to the men of still earlier times, the Cinnas
and Marii and Carbos, they viewed their country as a
prize and booty for competition, and all but in express
words fought to get a tyranny. But as to Brutus, they
say that not even his enemies imputed to him such a
change in his purpose, but that many persons had heard
Antonius say, he thought Brutus was the only person who
conspired against Cæsar because of being moved by the
splendour and apparent noble nature of the deed, and that
the rest combined against the man because they hated and
envied him. Accordingly it appears from what Brutus
says that he trusted not so much in his power as in his
virtues. He wrote to Atticus when he was just approaching
the danger, that his affairs were in the best plight as
to fortune, for that he should either get the victory <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>and
free the Roman people, or should die and be released from
slavery; and though everything else was safe and secure
for them, one thing was uncertain, whether they should
live and be free or die. He says that Marcus Antonius
was paying a just penalty for his folly, for while he
might have been numbered with the Bruti and Cassii and
Catos, he made himself an appendage to Octavius, and if
he should not be defeated with him, he would shortly
after have to fight against him. Now he seems, in saying
this, to have well divined what was to happen.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="m30"></a> While they were then in Smyrna, Brutus claimed
a share of the money which Cassius had collected to a great
amount, for Brutus alleged that he had expended all his
own resources in building so great a fleet with which they
would command all the internal sea.<a id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_550_550">550</a> But the friends of
Cassius were not for letting him give up the money, saying,
“What you save by economy and get with odium, it is
not fair that he should take and apply to gaining popularity
and gratifying the soldiers.” However, Cassius gave
him a third part of all. Separating again to their several
undertakings, Cassius, after taking Rhodes, did not conduct
himself with moderation, but made this answer at his entrance
to those who addressed him as king and lord: “I am
neither king nor lord, but the executioner and punisher of
lord and king.” Brutus demanded of the Lycians money
and men. When Naucrates the demagogue persuaded the
cities to revolt, and the people occupied certain heights to
prevent Brutus from passing, in the first place he sent
cavalry against them when they were eating, who killed
six hundred of them; and in the next place taking possession
of the posts and forts, he released all the people without
ransom with the view of gaining over the nation by
kindness. But the people were obstinate, being enraged
at what they had suffered, and despising his moderation
and humanity, till at last Brutus drove into Xanthas<a id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_551_551">551</a> the
most warlike of the Lycians, and blockaded them there.
Some of them attempted to escape by swimming under the
river which flowed by the city: but they were caught by
nets which were sunk in the channel to the bottom, and
the tops of the nets had bells attached to them which gave
a signal as soon as any one was caught. The Xanthians,
making a sally by night, threw fire on certain engines;
and when they were driven back into the town by the
Romans who perceived them, and a strong wind began to
blow against the battlements the flame which was laying
hold of the adjoining houses, Brutus, who feared for the
city, ordered his soldiers to help to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="m31"></a> But the Lycians were all at once seized with a
horrible impulse to despair surpassing all description,
which might be best likened to a passion for death; for
with their wives and children, both freemen and slaves, and
people of every age, they threw missiles from the walls upon
the enemy who were assisting to quench the flames, and
carrying reeds and wood and everything combustible, they
drew the fire to the city, offering to it all kinds of material
and in every way exciting and feeding it. As the
flames rushed onwards and engirdling the city blazed forth
with violence, Brutus, in great affliction at what was going
on, rode round the walls, being eager to save the people,
and stretching out his hands to the Xanthians he prayed
them to spare themselves and save the city; and yet no
one regarded him, but in every way they sought to destroy
themselves; and not only men and women, but even the
little children; with cries and shouts, some leaped into the
fire and others broke their necks from the walls, and others
presented their throats to their fathers’ knives, baring them
and bidding them strike. After the city was destroyed,
there was found a woman suspended by a rope, with a dead
child hung to her neck, and firing the house with a lighted
torch. This tragical sight Brutus could not endure to see,
and he wept at hearing of it; and he proclaimed that a
reward should be given to every soldier who could save a
Lycian. They say that there were only one hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>fifty who did not escape being saved. Now the Xanthians
after a long interval, as if they were reproducing a fated
period of destruction, renewed the fortune of their ancestors
in their desperation; for their ancestors in like
manner in the time of the Persians burnt their city and
destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="m32"></a> Brutus seeing that the city of Patara was preparing
to resist him was unwilling to attack it, and was
perplexed because he feared the same desperation; and
as he had their women captive, he let them go without
ransom. These women, who were the wives and daughters
of distinguished men, reported of Brutus that he was a
most moderate and just man, and they persuaded the
citizens to yield and to surrender the city. Upon this all
the rest of the Lycians surrendered and gave themselves
up to him, and they found him to be honourable and
merciful beyond their expectation; for while Cassius
about the same time compelled all the Rhodians to bring
in the gold and silver which was their private property,
and a sum of eight thousand talents was thus collected,
and mulcted the commonwealth of the city in five hundred
talents besides, Brutus only demanded of the Lycians a
hundred and fifty talents, and without doing them any
other wrong set out for Ionia.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="m33"></a> Now Brutus did many deeds worthy of remembrance
both in rewarding and punishing according to
desert; but that with which he himself was most pleased
and the best of the Romans, I will relate. When Pompeius
Magnus landed in Egypt at Pelusium, what time he fled
after being completely defeated by Cæsar, the guardians
of the king, who was still a youth, being in counsel with
their friends, were not inclined the same way in their
opinions. Some were for receiving and others for driving
the man from Egypt. But one Theodotus<a id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_552_552">552</a> of Chios, who
was hired to teach the king rhetoric, and was then thought
worthy of a place in the council for want of better men,
attempted to show that both were in error, those who
advised to receive and those who advised to send away
Pompeius, for there was one thing in the present circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
that was useful, and that was to receive him and
put him to death. And he added, at the end of his speech,
that a corpse does not bite. The council assented to his
opinion, and Pompeius Magnus fell, an instance of things
passing belief and expectation, and the result of the
rhetorical skill and eloquence of Theodotus, as the sophist
himself used to say boastingly. When Cæsar arrived
shortly after, some of them paid the penalty of their guilt
and perished miserably; and Theodotus, who borrowed
from fortune a short period for an inglorious and poor and
rambling life, did not escape Brutus when he came into
Asia, but he was carried before him and punished, and
thus he gained a greater name by his death than by his
life.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="m34"></a> Brutus invited Cassius to Sardis<a id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_553_553">553</a> and met
him with his friends on his approach; and the whole force
under arms saluted both of them as Imperatores. Now
as it is wont to happen in the midst of great affairs, and
among many friends and commanders, causes of difference
had arisen between Brutus and Cassius, and suspicions;
and before they did anything else, immediately on their
arrival at Sardis they entered into a room by themselves
and closed the door, and no one being present they began
with blaming one another, and then fell to proofs and
charges. From this they came to tears and passionate
expressions without restraint, so that their friends, wondering
at the roughness and violence of their anger, feared
lest something should happen; but it was forbidden to
approach them. But Marcus Favonius, who had been a
lover of Cato, and was a philosopher not so much from
reason as a certain impulse and mad passion, went in to
them though the slaves attempted to hinder him. But it
was a hard thing to check Favonius when he had put
himself in motion towards any object, for he was impetuous
in all things and impatient. He made no account
of being a Roman senator, but by his cynical freedom of
speech he often took away the harshness and unseasonableness
of his behaviour, the hearers receiving all as jest. On
this occasion forcing his way against those who tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>stop him, he entered, and with mock solemnity uttered
the words which Homer<a id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_554_554">554</a> has made Nestor use:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Obey: ye both are younger far than I,”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>and what follows. At which Cassius laughed, but Brutus
turned him out, calling him true dog and false cynic. However,
they forthwith became reconciled, and this was the end
of their difference for the time. Cassius gave an entertainment
to which Brutus invited his friends.<a id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_555_555">555</a> As they were
just reclining, Favonius came from the bath; and, on
Brutus declaring that he came without invitation and
bidding him withdraw to the highest couch,<a id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_556_556">556</a> he forced his
way to the central couch and reclined there; and they
made merry over the banquet, and the mirth was not
without its zest nor unseasoned with philosophy.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="m35"></a> On the following day Lucius Pella,<a id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_557_557">557</a> a Roman
who had been prætor and trusted by Brutus, was charged
by the people of Sardis with taking money unlawfully,
and he was publicly condemned and declared infamous by
Brutus. This affair gave Cassius no small pain. For a few
days before, two of his friends who were convicted of the
same offence, he privately admonished and publicly acquitted,
and he still continued to employ them. Accordingly
he blamed Brutus as being too strict an observer of law and
justice at a time which required politic conduct and conciliatory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
measures. But Brutus told him to remember the
Ides of March on which they lulled Cæsar, who was not
himself oppressing and plundering everybody, but supported
others who did it, so that if there was any specious
pretext for overlooking justice, it would have been better to
bear with Cæsar’s friends than to allow their own friends
to do wrong. For they, he said,<a id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_558_558">558</a> have the imputation of
cowardice, but we of injustice, and that too joined to danger
and toil. Such were the principles of Brutus.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="m36"></a><a id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_559_559">559</a> When they were going to cross over from
Asia, it is said that Brutus had a great sign. The man
was naturally wakeful, and by discipline and temperance
he contracted his sleep into a small space of time, never
reposing in the daytime, and by night only so long as he
was unable to do anything or to speak to any one because
people were resting. But at that time when the war was
on foot, having on his hands the general management of
everything, and his thoughts being on the stretch with
regard to the future, when he had taken a short repose
after eating, he employed the rest of the night on affairs
of urgency. And when he had finished and arranged
everything that was necessary about such matters, he
would read a book till the third watch, at which time the
centurions and tribunes were used to come to him. Being
then about to convoy his army over from Asia, it happened
to be dead of night and the lamp in his tent was not very
bright; and the whole camp was in deep silence. As
Brutus was considering and reflecting with himself, he
thought that he heard some one come in, and looking
towards the entrance he saw a terrible and strange vision
of a huge and frightful figure standing by him in silence.
He had the courage to ask, “What man or god art thou, or
with what purpose dost thou come to us?” The phantom
replied to him, “I am thy evil dæmon, Brutus, and thou
shalt see me at Philippi.” And Brutus without being disturbed,
said, “I shall see.”</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="m37"></a><a id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_560_560">560</a> When the phantom disappeared, Brutus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>called the slaves, and as they said that they had neither
heard any voice nor seen anything, Brutus still kept awake;
and at daybreak he betook himself to Cassius and told him
his vision. Cassius, who followed the doctrines of Epicurus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>
and was accustomed to dispute about them with Brutus,
said, “Our opinion, Brutus, is this, that we do not in
fact feel all things nor see them, but perception is a certain
flexible and deceitful thing, and the intellect is still quicker
to move and change it, without there being any real thing,
into all forms. For the fashioning of the form is like unto
wax, and as the soul of man possesses both the thing to be
fashioned and that which fashions, being the same, it has
of itself the power of most easily varying itself and assuming
different forms. And this is shown by the changes
of our dreams in sleep, which changes the phantastic power
undergoes, from slight causes assuming every kind of effect
and image. It is the nature of the phantastic power to be
always in motion, and motion is to it a certain phantasy or
perception. In you the body being troubled naturally
excites and perverts the mind. But it is neither probable
that there are dæmons, nor that, if there are, they have
the form of men or the voice, or that their power reaches
to us; and indeed I wish it were so, that we might not
put trust only in arms and horses and so many ships, but
also in the help of the gods being the leaders in most upright
and noble undertakings.” By such arguments as these
Cassius attempted to calm Brutus. When the soldiers
were embarking, two eagles descended on the first standards
and were carried along with them, and accompanied the
soldiers, who fed them, as far as Philippi. And there, one
day before the battle, they flew away.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="m38"></a> Now Brutus had subjected to him most of
the nations that lay in his way: and if any city or ruler
had been passed by, they then brought over all in their
progress as far as the sea opposite to Thasos. In those
parts Norbanus<a id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_561_561">561</a> and his troops happened to be encamped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>in the Straits and about Symbolum; but Brutus and
Cassius getting round them compelled them to withdraw
and desert the posts. They also came very near taking
his force, Cæsar staying behind on account of illness;
and they would have done it, if Antonius had not come to
their aid with such wonderful expedition that Brutus could
scarce believe it. Cæsar arrived ten days later, and pitched
his camp opposite to Brutus: Antonius took his station
opposite to Cassius. The plain which lay between the
armies, the Romans called the Campi Philippi; and it was
on this occasion that the largest Roman armies were
matched against one another. Now in numbers they were
not a little inferior to those of Cæsar, but in show and
splendour of arms the forces of Brutus outshone the
enemy. For most of their armour was of gold, and silver
had been unsparingly supplied, though in other respects
Brutus accustomed his officers to a simple and severe
habit. But he thought that the wealth which they had in
their hands and about their bodies, would give courage to
the more ambitious of honour and would make those who
were fond of gain still more courageous, as if the weapons
which they held were their property.</p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="m39"></a> Now Cæsar made a lustration<a id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_562_562">562</a> within his
lines, and distributed among the soldiers a small allowance
of grain and five drachmæ apiece for the sacrifice; but
Brutus, who considered this either as proof of Cæsar’s
poverty or his meanness, first of all performed a lustration
for the army under the open sky, according to the custom,
and then distributed a number of victims for every cohort,
and fifty drachmæ to each man, by which he had the
advantage over the enemy in the goodwill and zeal of his
troops. Notwithstanding this a bad omen, as Cassius
considered it, happened during the lustration; for the
lictor brought him his crown reversed. It is said that on
a former occasion, also during a certain spectacle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>
procession, a golden Victory belonging to Cassius, which
was being carried, fell down owing to the bearer slipping.
Besides this many birds of prey daily appeared in the
camp and swarms of bees were seen collecting about a
certain spot within the lines, which the diviners enclosed
in order to get rid of the superstitious fear which was
gradually withdrawing even Cassius himself from the
principles of Epicurus, and had completely cowed the
soldiers. Owing to this, Cassius was not eager that the
matter should be decided at present by a battle, and he
was of opinion that they should protract the war, being
strong in resources, but in amount of arms and men
inferior to the enemy. But Brutus even before this was
eager to settle the matter by the speediest hazard, and
thus either to recover freedom for his country, or to relieve
from their sufferings all the people who were oppressed
by cost and military service and requisitions. And now
seeing that his cavalry was successful and victorious in the
skirmishes and encounters of posts, his spirit was raised:
and some desertions to the enemy which took place and
imputations and suspicions against others caused many of
the friends of Cassius in the council to go over to the
opinion of Brutus. One of the friends of Brutus, Atillius,
opposed the opinion of Brutus and advised that they should
wait for the winter. On Brutus asking, Wherein he
thought that he would be better after a year, he replied, If
in nothing else, I shall live longer. Cassius was vexed at
this, and Atillius gave no small offence to the rest. Accordingly
it was resolved to fight on the next day.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="m40"></a> Brutus went to rest after having been in high
spirits and engaged in philosophical discourse at supper.
As to Cassius, Messala<a id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_563_563">563</a> says that he supped by himself
with a few of his intimates, and appeared thoughtful and
silent, though he was not naturally so; and that after
supper he pressed the hand of Messala strongly and said,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>as he was wont when he was in friendly mood, in the
Greek language, “I call you to witness, Messala, that I
am in the same situation as Pompeius Magnus, being compelled
to cast the die for my country’s safety in a single
battle. However, let us have a good heart, looking to
fortune, which it is not right to distrust, though we may
have resolved badly.” Messala says that these were the
last words that Cassius spoke to him and thereon
embraced him, and that he was invited<a id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_564_564">564</a> by him to supper
for the following day, which was his birthday. At daybreak
there was hung out in the lines of Brutus and of
Cassius the signal for the contest, a purple vest, and they
met between the two camps, and Cassius said: “Brutus, I
hope we may be victorious and live together happily all
the rest of our lives; but as the chief of human events
are the most uncertain, and if the battle results contrary
to our expectation, it will not be easy for us to see one
another, what do you intend with respect to flight or
death?” Brutus replied, “When I was a young man,
Cassius, and inexperienced in affairs, I know not how it
happened that I neglected a weighty matter in philosophy.
I blamed Cato for killing himself, considering that it was
not right nor befitting a man to withdraw himself from
his dæmon, and not to await what happens without fear,
but to skulk away. But now I am of a different mind in
the circumstances, and if the deity shall not determine in
our favour, I do not want to try other hopes and means, but
I will withdraw content with fortune, that on the Ides of
March I gave to my country my life and have lived another
life for her sake free and glorious.” Whereat Cassius
smiled and, embracing Brutus, said, “With such thoughts
let us go against the enemy; for we shall either conquer
or we shall not fear the conquerors.” After this they
discussed the order of battle in the presence of their
friends. Brutus asked Cassius to allow him to command
the right wing, which was supposed to be more appropriate
for Cassius on account of his experience and his age.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>But Cassius granted even this, and he commanded
Messala with the bravest of the legions to be posted on
the right. Brutus immediately led forth the cavalry
equipped in splendid style, and he brought up the infantry
with equal expedition.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="m41"></a> The soldiers of Antonius happened to be driving
trenches from the marshes, around which they were encamped,
into the plain and cutting off the approaches of
Cassius to the sea. Cæsar was on the watch, not being
present himself by reason of sickness, but his troops were
there, which, however, did not expect that the enemy would
fight, but would merely make sallies against the works
and disturb the diggers with light missiles and shouts;
and as they were paying no attention to those who were
opposed to them, they were surprised at the shouts about
the trenches, which were indistinct and loud. In the
meantime billets came from Brutus to the officers in
which the word was written, and as he was advancing on
horseback before the legions and encouraging them, a
few had time to hear the word as it was passed along,
but the greater part without waiting, with one impulse
and shout rushed against the enemy. Some irregularity
arose in the lines and some separation of them through
this disorder, and the legion of Messala first and those
which were close upon it outflanked Cæsar’s left; and
having slightly touched the soldiers on the extreme left
and killed no great number, but completely outflanking
them, fell on the camp. Cæsar, as he says in his Memoirs,
inasmuch as one of his friends, Artorius Marcus,<a id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_565_565">565</a> had seen
a vision in his sleep which bade Cæsar get out of the way
and leave the camp, had just before been conveyed out of it,
and he was supposed to have lost his life; for the enemy
pierced his empty litter with javelins and spears. And
there was a slaughter in the camp of those who were
captured, and two thousand Lacedæmonians, who had
lately come as allies, were cut to pieces with them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span></p>
<p>XLII.<a id="m42"></a> They who had not surrounded the soldiers of
Cæsar, but had engaged with those in front, easily put to
flight the enemy who were in confusion, and destroyed at
close quarters three legions, and they rushed into the
camp with the fugitives, carried along by the impetuosity
of success and having Brutus with them; but what the
victors did not see, that the critical time showed to the
vanquished. For pushing forward to the parts of the
opposite line which were exposed and broken where the
right wing was drawn off in the pursuit, they did not force
the centre but were engaged in a violent struggle; but they
put to flight the left, which was in disorder and ignorant
of what had happened, and pursuing it to the camp they
plundered it, neither of the Imperatores being with them.
For Antonius, as they say, having at the beginning avoided
the attack, retreated to the marsh, and Cæsar could nowhere
be seen, as he had fled from the camp; but some
showed their bloody swords to Brutus supposing they had
killed him, and describing his appearance and age. And
now the centre had repelled their opponents with great
slaughter; and Brutus thought that he was completely
victorious as Cassius thought that he was defeated. And
this was the only thing which ruined their cause, that
Brutus did not aid Cassius because he thought that he was
victorious, and that Cassius did not wait for Brutus because
he thought that he had perished; for Messala considers
it a proof of victory that Brutus had taken three
eagles and many standards from the enemy, and the enemy
had taken nothing. Brutus now retreating after he had
destroyed Cæsar’s camp, was surprised not to see the tent
of Cassius standing out conspicuous, as usual, nor the rest
in their place, for most of the tents had immediately been
thrown down and torn in pieces by the enemy when they
broke in. But those who thought they could see better
than their comrades said to Brutus that they saw many
helmets glittering and many silver shields moving about
in the camp of Cassius, and they said it did not appear to
them that it was either the number or the armour of those
were left to guard the camp, but yet there did not appear to
be in that direction a number of corpses such as might be
expected if so many legions had been defeated. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
was the first thing that gave Brutus an idea of the misfortune;
and leaving a guard in the camp of the enemy he recalled
the pursuers and got them together to aid Cassius.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="m43"></a> And it had fared thus with him. He was
neither pleased at seeing the first onset of the soldiers of
Brutus without signal and order, nor was he pleased that
when they were victorious they rushed straight to plunder
and profit, taking no pains to get round and encircle the
enemy. Cassius, conducting his operations rather with
delay and waste of time than with vigour and judgment,
was surrounded by the right wing of the enemy; and
when he saw that, as soon as the cavalry broke away in
flight to the sea, the infantry also were giving way, he
endeavoured to stop and recall them. He also seized the
standard from one of the standard-bearers who was flying,
and fixed it in the ground before his feet, though even
those who were placed about his person no longer remained
with any spirit. In these circumstances, being pressed, he
retreated with a few men to a hill which had a view towards
the plain. He saw nothing in the plain, or with
difficulty the plunder of the camp, for he was weak of
vision; but the horsemen around him saw many approaching
whom Brutus sent. Cassius conjectured that they
were enemies and were in pursuit of him; yet he sent
Titinius, one of those who were with him, to see. The
horsemen did not fail to observe him approaching, and
when they saw a man who was a friend, and faithful to
Cassius, they shouted for joy, and some of his friends leaping
down from their horses embraced him and took his
hand, and the rest riding round him with joyful shouts
and clatter by their unmeasured rejoicing produced the
greatest misfortune. For Cassius was quite sure that
Titinius was caught by the enemy. With these words,
“Through love of life have I waited to see a friend seized
by the enemy,” he retired into an empty tent dragging
after him one of his freed men, Pindarus, whom, in the unfortunate
affair of Crassus, he had prepared for this extremity.
Cassius escaped the Parthians, but now drawing
his cloak over his head and baring his neck he presented
it to be cut asunder; for the head was found separated
from the body. But no man saw Pindarus after the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>death
of Cassius, which made some persons think that he had
killed Cassius without his order. Shortly after the horsemen
appeared, and Titinius crowned by them went up to
Cassius. But when, by the weeping and cries of his friends
who were lamenting and bewailing, he knew of the fate of
the general and of his error, he drew his sword and with
much upbraiding of himself for his tardiness killed himself.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="m44"></a> Brutus, who was acquainted with the defeat of
Cassius, was now approaching, and he heard of his death
when he was near the camp. After lamenting over the
body and calling Cassius the last of the Romans, as if he
considered that such a spirit could never again be produced
in Rome, he wrapped up the corpse and sent it to Thasos,
that no disorder might be produced by its being interred
there. He summoned the soldiers together and consoled
them; and seeing that they were deprived of all necessaries
he promised them two thousand drachmæ apiece in place of
what they had lost. The soldiers were encouraged by his
words and admired the magnitude of his present; and
they accompanied him with shouts as he went away, magnifying
him as the only one of the four Imperatores who
was unvanquished in battle. And the result proved that
he had good reason for trusting to success in the battle;
for with a few legions he put to flight all those who
opposed him. But if he had employed all his forces in
the battle, and the greater part had not passed by the
enemy and fallen on the enemy’s baggage, it is probable
that he would have left no part of the enemy’s force unvanquished.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="m45"></a> There fell on the side of Brutus eight thousand,
with the slaves who were with them in the army, whom
Brutus called Briges;<a id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_566_566">566</a> and of the enemy Messala says
that he thinks more than twice the number fell. For this
reason the enemy was the more dispirited, till a slave of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>Cassius, named Demetrius, came to Antonius as soon as it
was evening, having taken the cloaks from the corpse, and
the sword; and when these were brought, they were so
much encouraged that at daybreak they led forth their
force prepared for battle. But as both his armies were in
an unsettled and dangerous state (for his own army being
full of captives required careful watching, and the army
of Cassius was troubled at the loss of their general, and
they felt somewhat of envy and dislike in consequence of
their defeat towards the army that had been victorious),
Brutus resolved to put his troops under arms, but he would
not fight. Of the captives, he ordered the slaves to be
killed, as they were moving about among the soldiers in a
suspicious way; but of the freemen he released some,
saying that they had rather been made captives by the
enemy, and were captives and slaves there, but with him
were free men and citizens; and when he saw that his
friends and the officers were ill-disposed towards them, he
saved them by concealing them and sending them away.
There were a certain Volumnius,<a id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_567_567">567</a> a mime, and Saculio, a
jester, among the prisoners, whom Brutus cared not for,
and his friends bringing these to him accused them of not
abstaining even now from speaking and jeering to insult
them. Brutus was silent, being occupied with other
thoughts, but Messala Corvinus was of opinion that they
should be flogged in a tent, and given up naked to the
generals of the enemy, that they might know what kind
of drinking companions and intimates they wanted in
their campaigns. Some of those who were present laughed;
but Publius Casca, who had struck Cæsar first, said, “We
offer no fit sacrifice to Cassius who is dead, by making
merry and jesting; but you, Brutus,” he said, “will show
what remembrance you have of the general either by
punishing or protecting those who will mock and revile
him.” Upon this Brutus, greatly angered, said, “Why
then do you ask me, Casca, and why don’t you do what
you like?” This answer of Brutus they considered as an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>assent to the punishment of the unhappy men, whom they
led away and put to death.</p>
<p>XLVI.<a id="m46"></a> After this Brutus gave the soldiers their present,
and blaming them mildly for not having waited for the
word, and having fallen on the enemy somewhat disorderly
without waiting for the order, he promised them if they
were victorious to give up to them for plunder and profit
two cities, Thessalonica<a id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_568_568">568</a> and Lacedæmon. This is the
only thing in the life of Brutus which he is charged with
that admits of no defence, though Antonius and Cæsar paid
to their soldiers a much more terrible price as the reward
of their victories, for they drove the old settlers out of
nearly the whole of Italy, that their soldiers might have
land and cities to which they had no claim. But with
Antonius and Cæsar dominion and power was the end
which they proposed to themselves in the war, while
Brutus, owing to his reputation for virtue, was not allowed
by the many either to conquer or to save his life otherwise
than by honourable and just means; and especially now
that Cassius was dead, who had the imputation of urging
Brutus on to some of his more violent acts. But as at sea
when the helm is broken, they attempt to nail on other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>pieces of wood, and to fit them, not skilfully indeed, but
as well as they can under circumstances, fighting against the
necessity, so Brutus with so great a force around him, and
in so hazardous a state of affairs, having no commander of
equal weight with himself, was compelled to employ those
who were with him, and to do and say many things according
to their pleasure. And he judged it fit to do whatever
he thought would improve the disposition of the soldiers
of Cassius, for they were difficult to manage: in the camp
being unruly for want of discipline, and towards the enemy
having a feeling of cowardice by reason of their defeat.</p>
<p>XLVII.<a id="m47"></a> Affairs were no better with Cæsar and
Antonius, for they were scantily supplied with provisions,
and owing to the camp being pitched in a hollow, they
expected a bad winter. For being among marshes and
the autumnal rains coming on after the battle, they had
their tents filled with mud and with water which froze
immediately through the cold. While they were in this
condition, news arrived of the misfortune that had befallen
their forces at sea. For the ships of Brutus<a id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_569_569">569</a> fell upon them,
and destroyed a large force that was coming to Cæsar
from Italy, and only a very few of the men escaped,
who were compelled by famine to eat the sails and ropes.
On hearing this news they were eager to settle the matter
by a battle before Brutus was aware of the great good
fortune that had come to him; for it happened that in the
same day the battle by land and the battle by sea were
determined. But by some chance rather than through
the fault of the commanders of the fleet, Brutus was
ignorant of the success, though twenty days had elapsed.
For otherwise he would not have gone out to a second battle
when he was provided with all necessaries for his army for
a long time and was posted in a good position, wherein he
could have maintained his army in the winter free from all
suffering and safe against the attacks of the enemy, and
by being master of the sea, and having defeated by land
the troops opposed to him, was in high hopes and spirits.
But affairs, as it appears, being no longer governable by a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>number, and requiring a monarchy, the deity wishing to
lead away and to remove the only person who stood in the
way of him who was able to govern, cut off the news of
that good fortune, though it came exceeding near to being
communicated to Brutus. For the day before that on
which he was going to fight, and late in the day, there
came one Clodius, a deserter from the enemy, who
reported, that Cæsar was eager to come to a decisive
contest because he had heard of the destruction of his
armament. The man got no credit for his report nor did
he come into the presence of Brutus, being altogether
despised as one who had heard no well-founded news, or
reported falsehood to get favour.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="m48"></a> In that night it is said that the phantom
again appeared to Brutus, and displaying the same appearance
said nothing and went away. But Publius Volumnius,<a id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_570_570">570</a>
a philosopher and one who accompanied Brutus in
his campaign from the first, says that this was not the
sign; but he says that the first eagle was covered with bees,
and from the arm of one of the centurions an oil of roses
spontaneously burst out, and though they often rubbed it
off and wiped it away, it was all to no use. Further,
before the battle, two eagles met and fought in the space
between the armies, and a silence past belief filled the
plain while all were looking on, but at last the eagle which
was on the side of Brutus gave way and fled. The
Ethiopian became notorious, he who met the eagle-bearer
as soon as the gate was opened, and was cut down with
their swords by the soldiers, who considered it a bad omen.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="m49"></a> After Brutus had made the line advance, and
had placed it in front of the enemy, he paused some time,
for suspicions reached him and information against certain
persons while he was inspecting the army; and he observed
that the cavalry were not very eager to begin the battle,
but were still waiting for the infantry to commence the
attack. All of a sudden, a man of military skill, who had
been particularly distinguished for his courage, rode past
Brutus himself and passed over to the enemy: his name
was Camulatus. Brutus was greatly pained at seeing this,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>and partly through passion, partly through fear of greater
change and treachery, he forthwith led his men against
the enemy, the sun now going down, to the ninth hour.
Brutus had the advantage with his own troops, and he
pushed on, pressing upon the left wing of the enemy which
gave way, and the cavalry supported him by charging
together with the infantry the disordered ranks; but the
other wing, which the commanders extended for fear of
being surrounded, was inferior in numbers, and was drawn
out in the centre, and thus becoming weak, did not resist
the enemy, but fled first. The enemy, having broken this
wing, immediately surrounded Brutus, who displayed all
the virtues of a general and a soldier, both in his personal
exertions, and his prudent measures in the midst of danger
to secure victory; but he was damaged by that circumstance
whereby he gained advantage in the former battle. For
in that battle the part of the enemy which was defeated
had perished; but few perished of the troops of Cassius,
though they were put to flight, and those who escaped
being very timid through their former defeat, filled the chief
part of the army with despondency and confusion. On this
occasion also, Marcus the son of Cato,<a id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_571_571">571</a> fighting among the
noblest and bravest of the youth, though hard pressed, did
not yield nor flee, but laying about him and calling out
who he was, and his father’s name, he fell on a heap of
the enemy’s slain. There fell, too, the bravest of the men,
exposing themselves in defence of Brutus.</p>
<p>L.<a id="m50"></a> Among the intimates of Brutus was one Lucilius,<a id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_572_572">572</a>
a good man. Observing that some barbarian horsemen
in their pursuit paid no regard to the rest, but rode at full
speed after Brutus, he resolved at his own risk to stop
them. And being a little in the rear he said that he was
Brutus, and he gained belief by praying them to take him
to Antonius, because he feared Cæsar, but trusted in
Antonius. The barbarians delighted at their success, and
considering that they had surprising good luck, conducted
the man, and as it was now growing dark, sent forward
some of their number as messengers to Antonius. Antonius,
much pleased, went to meet those who were conducting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span>Lucilius; and those who heard that Brutus was being
brought alive flocked together, some pitying him for his
ill fortune, and others thinking it unworthy of his fame to
let himself be taken by barbarians through love of life.
When they were near, Antonius stopped, being doubtful
how he should receive Brutus, but Lucilius, approaching
with a cheerful countenance, said, “Antonius, no enemy
has taken Marcus Brutus, nor will: may fortune never
have such a victory over virtue. But he will be found,
whether alive or dead, in a condition worthy of himself.
But I who have deceived your soldiers am come to suffer,
and I deprecate no punishment, however severe, for what I
have done.” When Lucilius had said this, and all were in
amaze, Antonius, looking on those who conducted Lucilius,
said, “I suppose, fellow soldiers, you are vexed at your
mistake, and think that you have been grossly tricked.
But be assured that you have taken a better prey than
that which you were in search of. For while you were
seeking for an enemy, you have brought us a friend; for
as to Brutus, I know not by the gods, what I should have
done with him if he were alive, but such men as this, I
pray that I may have as friends rather than as enemies.”
Saying this he embraced Lucilius and for the time placed
him with one of his friends, but he afterwards employed
him, and found him in everything faithful and true.</p>
<p>LI.<a id="m51"></a> Brutus, having crossed a certain stream, the banks
of which were lined with wood and steep, just when it
began to be dark, did not advance far, but seating
himself in a hollow spot where there was a large rock
spread out, with a few of his officers and friends about
him, first looked up to the heavens which were full of
stars, and uttered two verses, one of which Volumnius has
recorded:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Forget not,<a id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_573_573">573</a> Jove, the author of these ills;”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span></p>
<p>but the other he says that he forgot. After a while
naming each of his companions who had fallen in battle
before his eyes, he grieved most over the memory of
Flavius and Labeo. Labeo was his lieutenant, and
Flavius the chief of the engineers. In the meantime one
who was thirsty himself and saw that Brutus was in the
same plight, took a helmet and ran down to the river.
As a noise from the opposite side reached their ears,
Volumnius went forward to see, and Dardanus the shield-bearer
with him. Returning after a while they asked about
the water; and Brutus, smiling with a very friendly expression
on Volumnius, said, “It is drunk up, but some
more shall be brought for you.” The same person was
sent, but he was in danger of being taken by the enemy
and escaped with difficulty after being wounded. As
Brutus conjectured that no great number of his men had
fallen, Statyllius<a id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_574_574">574</a> undertook to make his way secretly
through the enemy, for it was not possible in any other
way, and to inspect the camp, and after raising a fire-signal,
if he should find all safe there, to come back to
him. The fire-signal was raised, for Statyllius got to the
camp, but as a long time elapsed and he did not return,
Brutus said, “If Statyllius is alive he will come.” But it
happened that, as he was returning, he fell among the
enemy and was killed.</p>
<p>LII.<a id="m52"></a><a id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_575_575">575</a> In the course of the night, Brutus, as he sat on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>
the ground, turned to his slave Kleitus and spoke to him.
But as Kleitus kept silence and shed tears, Brutus drew
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>to him his shield-bearer Dardanus, and privately said something
to him. At last employing the Greek language he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">450</a></span>addressed Volumnius and reminded them of their philosophical
studies and discipline, and he urged him to put
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>his hand to his sword and to aid him in the thrust.
Volumnius refusing, and the rest being in the same disposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>
and some one saying that they must not stay there, but
fly, Brutus sprang up and said, “Certainly we must fly,
yet not with the feet, but with the hands.” Offering his
right hand to each with a cheerful countenance, he said
that he felt great pleasure, that no one of his friends
had deceived him, but he blamed fortune with respect to
his country; as for himself, he considered that he was
happier than the conquerors, in that not yesterday nor
yet recently, but even now he left behind him a reputation
for virtue, which those would not leave behind who
gained the victory by arms or by money, nor would they
make people think that unjust and vile men who had destroyed
just and upright men did not rule unmeritedly.
After entreating and urging them to save themselves, he
retired a little farther with two or three, among whom was
Strato who had become intimate with him from being his
instructor in rhetoric. Putting Strato close to him, and
pressing the bare sword with both hands on the handle,
he fell upon it and died. Others say that it was not
Brutus himself, but Strato who, at the earnest request of
Brutus, held the sword under him, averting his eyes, and
that Brutus throwing his breast upon it with violence, and
piercing it through, quickly died.</p>
<p>LIII.<a id="m53"></a> Messala<a id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_576_576">576</a> who was a friend of Brutus and became
reconciled to Cæsar, once on a time when Cæsar was at
leisure, brought this Strato to him, and with tears in his
eyes said, “This, Cæsar, is the man who did the last
service to my Brutus.” Cæsar received Strato and kept
him about him, and Strato was one of the Greeks who
showed themselves brave men in difficulties, and in the
battle at Actium. They say that Messala himself being
afterwards commended by Cæsar because, though he had
been one of their greatest enemies at Philippi for the sake
of Brutus, he had shown himself most zealous at Actium,
replied, “Yes, Cæsar, I have always been on the better and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
juster side.” When Antonius found the body of Brutus,<a id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_577_577">577</a> he
ordered it to be wrapped in the most costly of his purple
vests; and when he afterwards discovered that the purple
vest was stolen, he put the thief to death. The ashes he
sent to Servilia, the mother of Brutus. Nikolaus<a id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_578_578">578</a> the
philosopher and Valerius Maximus<a id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_579_579">579</a> relate that Porcia the
wife of Brutus being desirous to die, which none of her
friends would allow, but kept close and watched her,
snatched burning embers from the fire, and closing her
mouth, so died. Yet there is extant a letter of Brutus<a id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_580_580">580</a> to his
friends in which he upbraids them and laments about
Porcia, that she was neglected by them and had determined
to die because of her sufferings from disease.
Nikolaus therefore appears not to have known the time,
since the letter, if it is genuine, informs us of the malady,
and the love of the woman and the manner of her death.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span></p>
<h2>COMPARISON OF DION AND BRUTUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="n1"></a> Among the glories of these two men’s lives, it is
especially to be noticed, that each of them started from
small beginnings, and yet raised himself to the highest
position in the state; and this fact is peculiarly honourable
to Dion. Brutus owed much of his success to the help of
Cassius, who, though less trustworthy than Brutus in
matters of virtue and honour, gave equal proofs of courage,
skill, and energy in war, while some writers go so far as
to give him the entire credit of the plot against Cæsar,
and say that Brutus had no share in it. Dion on the
other hand was obliged to provide himself with friends
and fellow conspirators, no less than with arms, ships, and
soldiers. Furthermore, Dion did not, like Brutus, gain
wealth and power by the revolution and war which he
began, but even gave his own money to support the war,
and spent the property on which he might have lived
comfortably in exile in order to make his countrymen free.
We must remember, also, that Brutus and Cassius could
not have remained quiet after they left Rome, for they
had been condemned to death, and were being pursued, so
that they were forced to fight in their own defence.
When they risked their lives in battle it was for themselves
that they did so more than for their countrymen, whereas
Dion lived in exile more happily than the despot who
banished him, and nevertheless exposed himself to so
terrible a hazard in order to set Sicily free,</p>
<p>II.<a id="n2"></a> Yet it was not the same thing to free the Syracusans
from Dionysius and to rid the Romans of Cæsar. Dionysius
never denied that he was a despot, and had inflicted
countless miseries upon Sicily: while the government of
Cæsar, though its creation gave great offence, yet when <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">455</a></span>it
had been accepted and had overcome all opposition seemed
to be a despotism merely in name, for Cæsar did nothing
cruel or arbitrary, and rather appeared to have been sent
by heaven like a physician, to establish an absolute monarchy
in as mild a form as possible, at a time when that
remedy was necessary for Rome. In consequence of this
the people of Rome were grieved at the death of Cæsar,
and showed themselves harsh and inexorable to his murderers;
while the severest charges which were brought
against Dion by his countrymen were that he had allowed
Dionysius to escape from Syracuse, and that he had not
destroyed the tomb of the former despot.</p>
<p>III.<a id="n3"></a> In actual warfare Dion proved himself a faultless
general, as he succeeded brilliantly in every enterprise
planned by himself, and was able to remedy the failures
caused by the misconduct of others; while Brutus seems
not to have been wise in engaging in the last decisive
battle, and when it was lost did not attempt to retrieve his
fortunes, but gave himself up to despair, showing even less
confidence than Pompeius. Yet, his position was far from
hopeless, for he still retained a large part of his army, and
a fleet which gave him entire command of the sea. Again,
Dion cannot be accused of any crime like that which is the
greatest blot upon the character of Brutus, who after his
life had been saved by Cæsar’s goodness, and he had been
allowed to save as many as he pleased of his fellow captives,
after also he had been regarded by Cæsar as his friend, and
had been promoted by Cæsar above many others, murdered
his benefactor. On the contrary, Dion was the relative
and friend of Dionysius, and assisted him in maintaining
his government, and it was not until he was expelled from
his country, his wife wronged, and his property confiscated,
that he openly began a most just and lawful war against
the despot. Is there not, however, another view of this
question? That hatred of despotism and wrong which
is so highly honoured, was possessed by Brutus pure
and unalloyed by personal motives, for he had no private
grudge against Cæsar, and yet risked his life on behalf of
the liberty of the people: while Dion would never have
made war against Dionysius, if he had not been wronged
by him. This we learn distinctly from Plato’s letters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>
which prove that Dion did not begin his revolt until he
was banished by Dionysius, after which, he deposed the
tyrant. A common object made Brutus become the friend
of Pompeius, who was Cæsar’s enemy both personally and
politically, for Brutus made men his friends or his enemies
solely according to what he thought right: while Dion
assisted Dionysius much while he was on friendly terms
with him, and only made war against him out of anger at
his loyalty being suspected. For this reason many even
of his own friends believed that after removing Dionysius
from the throne he intended to succeed him, and to reign
though under some title more plausible than that of despot;
while even the enemies of Brutus admitted that he alone
of all the conspirators against Cæsar kept one object consistently
in view, which was to restore to the Romans
their ancient constitution.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="n4"></a> Apart from these considerations the struggle against
Dionysius was different from that against Cæsar. Dionysius
was despised even by his own associates for wasting
all his time with drink, dice, and women; whereas it shows
a certain magnanimity, and a spirit undismayed by any
danger, to have conceived the idea of dethroning Cæsar,
and not to have been overawed by the wisdom, power, and
good fortune of a man whose very name made the kings of
Parthia and India uneasy in their sleep. As soon as Dion
appeared in Sicily, thousands joined him to attack Dionysius,
while the power of Cæsar’s name even after his death
rallied his friends, and enabled a helpless child to become
at once the first of the Romans by assuming it, as though it
were a talisman to protect him against the might and hatred
of Antonius. If it be said that Dion only drove out Dionysius
after many fierce battles, whereas Brutus stabbed
Cæsar when he was naked and unguarded, yet it was in
itself a brilliant piece of generalship to have attacked so
powerful a man when he was naked and unguarded: for
he did not attack him on a sudden impulse, or alone, or
even with a few associates; but the plot had been laid
long before, and many were concerned in it, yet none betrayed
him. Either he chose only the bravest men, or else
the mere fact of their having been chosen and trusted by
Brutus made them brave. Dion on the other hand <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>trusted
worthless men; and this is discreditable to his judgment,
for they must either have been villains when he chose them
for his followers, or else they must have been originally
good, and have become worse during their connection with
him. Plato indeed blames him for choosing such men for
his friends, and at last he was murdered by them.</p>
<p>V.<a id="n5"></a> No one avenged the murder of Dion; but Antonius,
though Brutus’s enemy, nevertheless buried him with
honour, and Cæsar (Augustus) allowed the honours which
were paid to his memory to remain untouched. A brazen
statue of Brutus stands in the city of Milan, in Gaul, on this
side of the Alps. When Augustus saw this, which was a
good likeness and a capital piece of workmanship, he passed
by it, but stopped shortly afterwards, and before a large
audience called for the magistrates of the city, and told
them that he had caught them in the act of breaking the
peace by harbouring his enemy within their walls. They
at first, as may be imagined, denied the charge, and looked
at one another, not knowing to whom he alluded. Augustus
now turned round towards the statue, and, knitting his
brows, asked, “Is not this my enemy who stands here?”
At this the magistrates were even more abashed, and remained
silent. Augustus, however, smilingly commended
the Gauls for remaining true to their friends in misfortune,
and ordered the statue to be left where it stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF ARTAXERXES.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="o1"></a> The first Artaxerxes, who surpassed all the kings of
Persia in mildness and magnanimity of character, was
surnamed Longhand, because his right hand was larger
than his left. He was the son of Xerxes; and Artaxerxes
the Second, the subject of this memoir, who was surnamed
Mnemon, was the son of the former’s daughter: for Darius
and Parysatis had four children, of whom the eldest was
named Artaxerxes, the next Cyrus, and the two younger
ones Ostanes and Oxathres.</p>
<p>Cyrus was named after the ancient king of that name,
who is said to have been taken from the sun; for the
Persians are said to call the sun Cyrus. Artaxerxes was
originally named Arsikas, although the historian Deinon
states that he was named Oarses. Still Ktesias, although
his writings are full of all kinds of absurd and incredible
tales, must be supposed to know the name of the king at
whose court he lived, acting as physician to him, his
mother and his wife.</p>
<p>II.<a id="o2"></a> Cyrus from his earliest youth displayed a determined
and vehement disposition, while his brother was gentler
in all respects and less passionate in his desires. He
married a fair and virtuous wife at his parents’ command,
and kept her against their will, for the king killed her
brother, and wished to put her also to death, but Arsikas,
by tears and entreaties, prevailed upon his mother to
spare her life, and not to separate her from him. His
mother, however, always loved Cyrus more than
Artaxerxes, and wished him to become king instead of his
brother. For this reason, when Cyrus was sent for from the
coast during his father’s last illness, he went to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">459</a></span>court
with great expectations, imagining that she had managed
to have him declared heir to the throne. Indeed, Parysatis
had a good argument for doing so, which had formerly, at
the suggestion of Demaratus, been acted upon by the old
king Xerxes; namely, that when Arsikas was born,
Darius was merely a private man, but that when Cyrus
was born he was a king. However, Parysatis did not
succeed in inducing the king to declare Cyrus his heir,
but the eldest son was proclaimed king and his name
changed to Artaxerxes, while Cyrus was appointed satrap
of Lydia and ruler of the provinces on the sea coast.</p>
<p>III.<a id="o3"></a> Shortly before the death of Darius, the king
Artaxerxes travelled to Pasargadæ, in order that he might
be initiated into the royal mystic rites by the priests there.
The temple is dedicated to a warlike goddess whom one
might liken to Athena. The person to be initiated enters
this temple, removes his own clothes, and puts on those
which the ancient Cyrus wore before he became king.
He then eats some of a cake made of preserved figs, tastes
the fruit of the terebinth tree, and drinks a cup of sour
milk. Whether besides this he does anything else is known
only to the initiated. When Artaxerxes was about to do
this Tissaphernes met him, bringing with him one of the
priests, who, when both the princes were boys, had been
Cyrus’s teacher in the usual course of study, had taught
him to use incantations like a Magian, and had been especially
grieved at Cyrus not being proclaimed king. For this
reason he more easily obtained credit when he accused
Cyrus; and the accusation he brought against him was
that Cyrus intended to conceal himself in the temple, and
when the king took off his clothes, to attack him and
murder him. Some writers say that this was how Cyrus
came to be apprehended, while others state that he actually
got into the temple, and was there betrayed by the priest.
When he was about to be put to death, his mother threw
her arms round him, flung her hair over him, pressed his
neck against her own, and by her tears and entreaties
obtained his pardon, and got him sent back again to
his government on the sea coast. He was not satisfied
with this position nor was he grateful for his pardon, but
remembered only how he had been taken into custody, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>and
through anger at this became all the more eager to gain
the throne for himself.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="o4"></a> Some writers say that he revolted because his revenues
did not suffice for his daily expenses; but this is absurd,
since, if he could have obtained it from no other source, his
mother was always ready to supply him, and used to give
as much as he wanted from her own income. His wealth
also is proved by the large mercenary force which, we
learn from Xenophon, was enlisted by his friends and
guests in many different places: for he never collected it
together, as he wished to conceal his preparations, but he
kept many persons in different places who recruited
soldiers for him on various pretexts. His mother, who
was present at court, lulled the king’s suspicions, and
Cyrus himself constantly wrote to him in dutiful terms,
asking him to grant certain matters, and bringing accusations
against Tissaphernes, as though it was Tissaphernes
of whom he were jealous and with whom he had a quarrel.
There was also a certain slowness in the disposition of the
king, which was mistaken by the people for good nature.
At the beginning of his reign, he seemed inclined to rival
the gentleness of his namesake, as he made himself
pleasant to all whom he met, distributed honours and
favours even beyond men’s deserts, took no delight in insulting
and torturing evil-doers, and showed himself as
affable and courteous to those from whom he received favours
as he was to those upon whom he bestowed them. No
present was so trifling that he did not receive it gladly,
but even when a man named Onisus brought him a pomegranate
of unusual size, he said, “By Mithras, if this man
were given the charge of a small city he would soon make
it great!”</p>
<p>V.<a id="o5"></a> When during one of his journeys all men were
bringing him presents, a labouring man, not finding anything
else to give, ran to the river, took up some of the
water in his two hands and offered it to him. Artaxerxes
was pleased with the man, and sent him a gold drinking-cup
and a thousand darics. When Eukleidas the Lacedæmonian
had spoken his mind very freely to him, he bade
his general say to him, “You may say what you please,
but I may both say and do what I please.” Once <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">461</a></span>when
they were hunting, Teribazus pointed out to him that his
coat was torn. Artaxerxes asked what was to be done, to
which Teribazus answered, “Put on another coat, and
give this one to me.” He replied, “I will give it to you,
Teribazus, but I forbid you to wear it.” Teribazus,
however, who was a loyal subject, but careless and flighty,
immediately put on the coat, and ornamented himself with
women’s necklaces belonging to the king, so that all men
were disgusted with him, for it was not lawful to do so.
The king, however, laughed, and said, “I allow you to
wear the jewelry as a woman, and the coat as a fool.”
Though no one eats at the same table with the king of
Persia except his mother, who sits above him, or his
wedded wife, who sits below him, Artaxerxes invited his
younger brothers also, Ostanes and Oxathres, to sit at the
same table. One of the sights which especially delighted
the Persians was the carriage in which Statira, the wife of
Artaxerxes, drove, with the curtains drawn back, for the
queen allowed the people to greet her and approach her,
and was much beloved by them in consequence.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="o6"></a> However, all turbulent and unsettled spirits thought
that the empire required Cyrus at its head, since he was
a brilliant and warlike prince, a staunch friend to his
comrades, and a man of intellect and ambition, capable of
wielding the enormous power of Persia. Cyrus, when he
began the war, relied upon the attachment of the people of
the interior of Asia as much as he did upon that of his own
followers; and he wrote to the Lacedæmonians, begging
them to help him and to send soldiers to him, declaring
that if the soldiers came to him on foot, he would give
them horses, and if they came on horseback, he would
give them carriages and pairs, that if they possessed fields,
he would give them villages, and if they possessed villages
he would give them cities; and that his soldiers’ pay
should be given them by measure, instead of being counted
out to them. At the same time he boasted loudly about
himself, averring that he had a greater heart than his
brother, was a better philosopher, and was a more learned
Magian, and also that he could drink and carry more wine
than his brother, who, he declared, was so lazy and
cowardly that he would not even mount a horse <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span>when
hunting, or a throne in time of peril. The Lacedæmonians
now sent a skytale<a id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_581_581">581</a> to Klearchus, bidding him obey the
bidding of Cyrus in all things. Cyrus marched against
the King of Persia with a large force and nearly thirteen
thousand Greek mercenary troops, whom he had engaged
upon various pretences. His treason was not long undiscovered,
for Tissaphernes went in person to tell the
king of it, upon which there was a terrible scene of disorder
in the palace, since Parysatis was blamed as being
the chief instigator of the war, and her friends were all
viewed with suspicion as traitors. Parysatis was especially
enraged by the reproaches of Statira, who asked her loudly,
“Where now are the pledges you gave us? What has
come of the entreaties by which you begged off Cyrus
when he plotted against his brother’s life, now that you
have plunged us into war and misery?” In consequence
of these reproaches Parysatis conceived a vehement hatred
for Statira, and being of a fierce passionate unforgiving
temper, she plotted her destruction. Deinon states that
she effected her purpose during the war, but Ktesias says
that she did the deed afterwards, and I shall adopt his
account of the matter, for it is not probable that he, who
was an eye-witness of these events, did not know the order
in which they took place, or that in his history he should
have had any reason for misrepresenting them, although
he often departs from the exact truth with a view to
dramatic effect.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="o7"></a> As Cyrus marched onwards, many rumours and
reports were brought to him, that the king had determined
not to fight at once, and was not anxious to meet him in
battle, but that he intended to remain in Persia until his
forces had assembled there from all parts of the empire.
Indeed, although he had dug a trench across the plain ten
fathoms wide, as many deep, and four hundred stadia
long, yet he remained quiet and permitted Cyrus to cross
it, and to march close to Babylon itself. Teribazus, we
are told, was the first who ventured to tell the king that he
ought not to avoid a battle, and retreat from Media and
from Babylon, and even from Susa itself into Persia, when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>he possessed an army many times as great as that of the
enemy, and numberless satraps and generals who were
better generals and better soldiers than Cyrus. Upon
hearing this advice, the king determined to fight as soon
as possible. At first his sudden appearance with a
splendidly equipped force of nine hundred thousand men
caused great surprise and confusion among the rebels, who
had gained such confidence that they were marching
without their arms; and it was not without much shouting
and disorder that Cyrus was able to rally them and place
them in array. The king moved forward slowly and in
silence, so that the Greeks were filled with admiration at
the discipline of his army, for they had expected that in
such a host there would be disorderly shouts and
irregularity and intervals in the line. The strongest of
the scythed chariots were judiciously posted by Artaxerxes
in front of his line, in order that before the two armies
engaged hand to hand they might break the enemy’s ranks
by the force of their charge.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="o8"></a> The battle<a id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_582_582">582</a> has been described by many writers,
and as Xenophon’s narrative is so clear that the reader
seems almost to be present, and to see the different events
in the act of taking place, it would be folly for me to do
more than to mention some important particulars which he
has omitted. The place where the two armies met is called
Kunaxa, and is five hundred stadia distant from Babylon.
Before the battle Klearchus is said to have advised Cyrus
to post himself behind the ranks of the soldiers, and not to
risk his life; to which Cyrus replied “What say you,
Klearchus? Just when I am striving to win a kingdom,
do you bid me prove myself unworthy of one?” In the
action itself, though Cyrus made a great mistake in plunging
so rashly into the midst of the enemy without regarding
the risk that he ran, yet Klearchus was quite as
much, if not more to blame for not arraying his Greeks
opposite to the Persian king, and for resting his right wing
upon the river for fear he should be surrounded. If he
valued safety more than anything else, and cared only to
avoid the slightest risk of loss, he had better have stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>at home; but after he had marched ten thousand stadia
from the sea, under no compulsion, but solely in order to
place Cyrus upon the throne of Persia, then to be solicitous,
not for a post where he might win the victory for his chief
and paymaster, but merely for one where he might fight
without exposing himself, was to act like a man who, on
the first appearance of danger, abandons the whole enterprise
and gives up the object for which the expedition was
made. It is abundantly clear from what took place, that
if the Greeks had charged the troops who defended the
king’s person, they would have met with no resistance,
and if these men had been routed, and the king slain or
forced to take flight, Cyrus’s victory would at once have
placed him on the throne. It was, therefore, the overcaution
of Klearchus more than the rashness of Cyrus
which really caused the death of the latter and the ruin of
his cause; for the Persian King himself could not, if he
had wished, have placed the Greeks in a position where
they could do him less harm, for they were so far away
from him and his main body that he did not even perceive
that they had routed their antagonists, and Cyrus was
slain before Klearchus could reap any advantage from his
victory. Yet Cyrus knew what was best, for he ordered
Klearchus to post his men in the centre; but Klearchus,
saying that he would manage as well as he could, ruined
everything.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="o9"></a> The Greeks put the Persians to flight with the
greatest ease, and pursued them for a long distance.
Cyrus, as he rode forward, mounted upon a spirited, but
hard-mouthed and unmanageable horse, which, we learn
from Ktesias was named Pasakas, was met by Artagerses,
the leader of the Kadousians, who shouted loudly, saying,
“Most wicked and foolish of men, who hast disgraced the
name of Cyrus, erst the noblest in Persia, and bringest thy
base Greeks on a base errand, to plunder the good things
of the Persians, and to slay thy brother and thy lord, who
hath ten thousand times ten thousand slaves, each one
better than thou art. Soon shalt thou find out the truth
of this; for before thou seest the king’s face thou shalt
lose thine own head.” Saying thus, he hurled his javelin
against Cyrus, but his breastplate resisted the blow, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>and
Cyrus was not wounded, although he reeled in his saddle
from the violence of the stroke. As Artagerses wheeled
round his horse, Cyrus struck him with a javelin, driving
the point through his throat, beside the collar-bone. That
Artagerses was slain by Cyrus nearly all historians agree,
but as to the death of Cyrus himself, since Xenophon has
described it very shortly, as he was not an eye-witness of
it, we may as well give the accounts of it which Deinon
and which Ktesias have written.</p>
<p>X.<a id="o10"></a> Deinon says that when Artagerses fell, Cyrus
charged violently among the troops round the king, and
wounded the king’s horse. Artaxerxes was thrown from
his horse, but Teribazus quickly mounted him upon
another horse, saying, “My king, remember this day, for
you ought not to forget it.” Artaxerxes, he states, was
again thrown from his horse by the vehement onset of
Cyrus, and again mounted. At the third charge the king
who was violently enraged, and cried out to those around
him that it was better to die than be treated thus, rode
straight against Cyrus, who rashly and heedlessly exposed
himself to the missiles of his enemies. The king hurled
a dart at Cyrus, and so did, all his followers. Cyrus fell,
struck, some say by the king himself, but according to
others he was slain by a Carian soldier, on whom the king
afterwards, as a reward for this feat of arms, bestowed the
honour of marching at the head of the army, carrying a
golden cock upon a spear. Indeed the Persians call the
Carians themselves cocks, because of the plumes with
which they ornament their helmets.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="o11"></a> The story of Ktesias, reduced to a succinct form, is
as follows:—Cyrus, after slaying Artagerses, rode towards
the king himself, and the king rode towards him, both of
them in silence. Ariaeus, the friend of Cyrus, struck the
king first but did not wound him. The king hurled his
spear and missed Cyrus, but struck Satiphernes, a man of
noble birth and a trusted friend of Cyrus, and slew him.
Cyrus hurled his javelin at the king, drove it through his
breastplate, making a wound in his breast two fingers’
breadths deep, and cast him from his horse. Upon this
there was much disorder, and many took to flight. The
king rose, and with a few followers, among whom <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">466</a></span>was
Ktesias, took refuge on a hill hard by. Meanwhile Cyrus
was carried by his horse a long distance forward into the
midst of his enemies, and, as it was now growing dark, he
was not recognised by his foes, and was being sought for
in vain by his friends. Excited by his victory, and full
of spirit and pride, he rode about through the ranks, crying,
“Out of my way, wretches.” As Cyrus shouted these words
in Persian, some made way for him, but the tiara fell from
his head, and a young man named Mithridates, not knowing
who he was, hurled a javelin and struck him on the
temple near the eye. The wound bled profusely, and
Cyrus became dizzy and faint, so that he fell from his
horse. The horse rushed away from him and was lost,
but the servant of the man who struck Cyrus took up his
saddle-cloth, which fell from his horse, and which was
drenched with blood.</p>
<p>When Cyrus began to recover from the effects of this
blow, some few of his eunuchs tried to mount him upon
another horse and get him safe away from the field.
As, however, he could not mount, he proposed to walk, and
the eunuchs supported him as he went, faint and weak in
his body, but still imagining himself to be the victor as
he heard the fugitives calling Cyrus their king and
begging him for mercy. At this time certain men of
Kaunus, of mean and low condition, who followed the
king’s army to perform menial services, happened to join
the party with Cyrus, supposing them to be friends.
When, however, they managed to distinguish that the
surcoats which they wore over their armour were purple,
while all the king’s soldiers wore white ones, they perceived
that they were enemies. One of them ventured to
strike Cyrus from behind with a spear, not knowing who
he was. The javelin struck Cyrus behind the knee, cutting
the vein there, and in his fall he also struck his wounded
temple against a stone, and so died. This is the story of
Ktesias, in which he seems, as it were, to hack poor Cyrus
to death with a blunt sword.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="o12"></a> When Cyrus was dead it happened that Artasyras,
who was called the king’s eye,<a id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_583_583">583</a> rode past. Recognising the
eunuchs who were mourning over the body, he asked the
most trusted of them, “Pariskas, who is this beside whom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>you sit weeping?” He answered, “Artasyras, do you not
see that it is Cyrus, who is dead?” Artasyras was astonished
at this news, bade the eunuch be of good courage and
guard the body, and himself rode in haste to Artaxerxes,
who had given up all hope of success, and was in great
bodily suffering from his wound and from thirst. Artasyras,
with great delight, told him that he had seen Cyrus lying
dead. On hearing this Artaxerxes at first wished to go to
see it himself, and bade Artasyras lead him to the spot;
but as there was much talk and fear of the Greeks, who
were said to be advancing and carrying all before them;
he decided to send a party to view the body; and thirty
men went carrying torches. Meanwhile, as the king himself
was almost dying of thirst the eunuch Satibarzanes
went in search of drink for him; for there was no water in
the place where he was, nor indeed anywhere near the
army. After much trouble the eunuch at length fell in
with one of the low Kaunian camp followers, who had
about four pints of putrid water in a skin, which he took
from the man and carried it to the king. When the king
had drunk it all, he asked him if he was not disgusted
with the water; and the king swore by the gods that he
never had drank either wine or the purest of water with
such pleasure. “So,” added he, “if I be not able to find
the man who gave you this water and reward him for it, I
pray that the gods may make him rich and happy.”</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="o13"></a> While they were talking thus, the thirty men
rode up in high spirits, announcing to him his unlooked-for
good fortune. Artaxerxes now began to recover his
courage from the number of men who began to assemble
round him, and descended from the hill amidst the glare
of many torches. When he reached the body, the head
and right hand were cut off, in accordance with some
Persian custom. He ordered the head to be brought to
him, took hold of it by the long thick hair, and showed it
to those who were still wavering or fleeing. They all
were filled with amazement, and did homage to him, so
that he soon collected a force of seventy thousand men,
accompanied by whom he re-entered his camp. He had
left it in the morning, according to Ktesias, with an army
of four hundred thousand men; though Deinon and Xenophon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">468</a></span>
both estimate the forces actually engaged at a higher
figure. Ktesias states that the number of the dead was
returned to Artaxerxes as nine thousand, but that he
himself thought that the corpses which he saw lying on
the field must amount to more than twenty thousand.
This point admits of discussion; but Ktesias tells an
obvious untruth when he says that he was sent on an
embassy to the Greeks, together with Phalinus of Zakynthus,
and some other persons. Xenophon knew that
Ktesias was at the king’s court, for he makes mention of
him, and has evidently read his history; so that he never
would have passed him over, and only mentioned Phalinus
of Zakynthus, if Ktesias had really come as interpreter on
a mission of such importance. But Ktesias, being a wonderfully
vain man, and especially attached to the Lacedæmonians
and to Klearchus, constantly in his history
introduces himself, while he sings the praises of Lacedæmon
and of Klearchus.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="o14"></a> After the battle, Artaxerxes sent most splendid
and valuable presents to Artagerses, the son of the man
who had been slain by Cyrus, and handsomely rewarded
Ktesias and the rest of his companions. He sought out
the Kaunian from whom he had received the water-skin,
who was a poor and humble man, and made him rich
and honoured. He also took pains to appoint suitable
punishments to those who had misconducted themselves.
One Arbakes, a Mede, deserted to Cyrus during the battle,
and when Cyrus fell again returned to his allegiance.
Artaxerxes, perceiving that he had done so not from
treachery but from sheer cowardice, ordered him to carry
a naked courtesan about the market-place upon his
shoulders for the whole of one day. Another deserter,
who besides changing sides falsely boasted that he had
slain two of the enemy, was condemned by the king to
have his tongue pierced with three needles. As Artaxerxes
believed, and wished all men to think that he had himself
slain Cyrus, he sent presents to Mithridates, who was the
first man that wounded Cyrus, and bade those who carried
the presents say, “The king honours you with these
presents, because you found Cyrus’s saddle-cloth and
brought it to him.” And when the Carian, who <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span>had
struck Cyrus under the knee, demanded a present, he
bade those who carried the presents say, “The king gives
you these for having been second to bring him the good
news; for Artasyras first, and you next, brought him the
news of the death of Cyrus.” Mithridates retired in silence,
much vexed at this; but the unhappy Carian, as often
happens, was ruined by his own folly. Excited by his
good fortune into trying to obtain more than became him,
he refused to take what was offered him for having brought
good news, but remonstrated loudly, declaring that he,
and no one else, slew Cyrus, and that he was most unjustly
being deprived of the credit of the action. The king,
when he heard this, was greatly angered, and ordered the
man’s head to be struck off. His mother, Parysatis, who
was present, said, “My king, do not thus rid yourself of
this pestilent Carian. He shall receive from me a fitting
punishment for what he has dared to say.” The king
handed him over to her, and Parysatis ordered the executioners
to torture him for ten days, and then to tear out
his eyes and pour molten copper into his ears until he died.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="o15"></a> Mithridates also came to an evil end after a few
days by his folly. He came dressed in the robe, and
adorned with the ornaments which he had received from
the king, to a banquet at which the eunuchs of the king
and of the king’s mother were present. When they began
to drink the most influential of the eunuchs of Parysatis
said to him: “What a fine dress, Mithridates, and what
fine necklaces and bracelet the king has given you! How
valuable is your scimitar? Indeed, he has made you
fortunate and envied by all men.” Mithridates, who was
already in liquor, answered: “What are these things,
Sparamixes? I proved myself on that day worth more
than these to the king.” Sparamixes smiled and said,
“I do not grudge you them, Mithridates, but come—as
the Greeks say that there is truth in wine—tell us how
it can be so great or brilliant an achievement to find a
saddle-cloth that has fallen off a horse, and to bring it to
the king.” This the eunuch said, not because he did not
know the truth, but because he wished to lead Mithridates,
whose tongue was loosened by wine, to expose his folly
before the company. Mithridates could not <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span>restrain
himself, and said: “You may say what you please about
saddle-cloths and such nonsense; I tell you plainly, that it
was by my hand that Cyrus fell. I did not hurl my
javelin in vain, like Artagerses, but I just missed his eye,
struck him through the temple, and felled him to the
ground; and with that blow he died.” All the rest of
the guests, foreseeing the miserable end to which
Mithridates would certainly come, cast their eyes upon
the ground; but the host said: “My good Mithridates, let
us now eat and drink, adoring the fortune of the king, but
let us not talk about subjects which are too high for us.”</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="o16"></a> After this, the eunuch told Parysatis what
Mithridates had said, and she told the king, who was
much enraged, because he was proved not to have spoken
the truth, and had been deprived of the sweetest part of
his victory; for he wished to persuade all men, Asiatics
and Greeks alike, that in the skirmish when he and his
brother met he himself had been wounded by Cyrus, but
had struck him dead. He therefore condemned Mithridates
to the punishment of the boat. This is as follows:—Two
wooden boats are made, which fit together. The
criminal is placed on his back in one of them, and then
the other is placed over him, and the two are fastened so
as to leave his head, feet, and hands outside, but covering
all the rest of his body. They give him food, and if he
refuses it, they force him to eat it by pricking his eyes.
When he has eaten they pour a mixture of milk and
honey into his mouth and over his face. They then keep
turning his eyes towards the sun, his whole face becomes
completely covered with flies. As all his evacuations are
necessarily contained within the boat, worms and maggots
are generated from the corruption, which eat into his body;
for when the man is certainly dead, they take off the
upper boat and find all his flesh eaten away, and swarms
of these animals clinging to his bowels and devouring
them. In this way Mithridates died, after enduring his
misery for seventeen days.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="o17"></a> The only remaining object of the vengeance of
Parysatis was Masabates, the king’s eunuch who cut off
the head and hand of Cyrus. As he gave no handle against
himself, Parysatis devised the following plot against him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span>
She was naturally a clever woman, and was fond of playing
with the dice. Before the war, she had often played with
dice with the king; and after the war when she became
reconciled to him she took part in his amusements, played
at games with him, encouraged his amours, and altogether
permitted Statira to have but very little of his society; for
Parysatis hated Statira more than any one else, and wished
to have most influence with Artaxerxes herself. Finding
Artaxerxes one day eager for amusement, as he had nothing
to do, she challenged him to play for a thousand darics.
She purposely allowed her son to win, and paid him the
money: and then pretending to be vexed at her loss, called
on him to cast the dice afresh for a eunuch. Artaxerxes
agreed, and they agreed to play upon the condition that
each of them should set apart five of their most trusty
eunuchs, and that the winner was to have his choice of
the rest. On these terms they played; and Parysatis,
who gave the closest attention to her game, and was also
favoured by fortune, won, and chose Masabates, who was
not one of the excepted ones. Before the king suspected
her purpose she had Masabates arrested, and delivered him
to the executioners with orders to flay him alive, impale
his body sideways upon three stakes, and hang up his skin
separately. This was done; and as the king was greatly
grieved at it and was angry with her, she smiled and said
ironically: “How pleasant and well-mannered you are, to
be angry about a miserable old eunuch, whereas I have
lost a thousand darics at dice and say nothing about it.”
The king, though he was sorry to have been so cheated,
yet remained quiet; but Statira, who indeed often on
other occasions openly braved Parysatis, was very indignant
with her for so cruelly and unjustly putting the
king’s faithful eunuch to death for Cyrus’s sake.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="o18"></a> When Tissaphernes betrayed Klearchus and
the other generals, broke his plighted word, seized them
and sent them away in chains, Ktesias tells us that Klearchus
asked him to provide him with a comb. When
Klearchus received it and combed his hair with it, he was
so much pleased that he gave Ktesias his ring, to be a
token to all Klearchus’s friends and relatives in Lacedæmon
of his friendship for Ktesias. The device <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span>engraved
upon the ring was a dance of Karyatides. At first the
soldiers who were imprisoned with Klearchus took away
the provisions which were sent to him and ate them themselves,
giving him but a small part of them. Ktesias says
that he remedied this also, by arranging that a larger
portion should be sent to Klearchus, and that a separate
allowance should be given to the soldiers. All these services
Ktesias states that he rendered in consequence of the
favour of Parysatis for the captives, and at her instigation.
He says, also, that as he sent Klearchus a joint of
meat daily in addition to his other provisions, Klearchus
begged him and assured him that it was his duty to hide a
small dagger in the meat, and send it to him, and not to
allow him to be cruelly put to death by the king; but he
was afraid, and did not dare to do it. Ktesias says that the
king’s mother pleaded with him for the life of Klearchus,
and that he agreed to spare him, and even swore to do so,
but that he was again overruled by Statira, and put them
all to death except Menon. It was in consequence of this,
according to Ktesias, that Parysatis began to plot against
Statira, and devised the plan for poisoning her, though it
seems very unlikely that it was only for the sake of Klearchus
that she dared to do such wickedness as to murder the
lawful wife of her king, who was the mother of the heirs
to the throne. But clearly all this was written merely for
dramatic effect, to do honour to the memory of Klearchus.
Ktesias writes, too, that when the generals were put to
death the remains of the others were thrown away to be
devoured by the dogs and fowls of the air; but that a violent
storm of wind heaped much earth over the body of Klearchus,
and that from some dates which were scattered
around there soon sprung up a fair and shady grove above
the place where he lay, so that the king sorely repented
of what he had done, thinking that in Klearchus he had
slain one who was a favourite of the gods.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="o19"></a> Parysatis, who had long been jealous of Statira
and hated her, and who saw that her own power depended
merely on the respect with which she was regarded by the
king, who loved and trusted Statira, now determined to
destroy her, though at the most terrible risk to herself.
She had a faithful maid-servant, named Gigis, who <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">473</a></span>was
high in her favour, whom Deinon accuses of having
assisted to administer the poison, though Ktesias says that
she was only privy to the plot, and that against her will.
Ktesias says that the man who procured the poison was
named Belitaris, but Deinon calls him Melantas. Now the
two queens, leaving off their former hatred and suspicion,
began again to visit one another and to dine together, but
yet mistrusted each other so much that they only ate the
same food from the same dishes. There is in Persia a
small bird, which has no excrements, but all its entrails
are filled with solid fat; it is supposed that it feeds upon
air and dew; the name of it is <i>rhyntakes</i>. Ktesias states
that Parysatis cut this bird in two with a small knife, one
side of which was smeared over with the poison. As she
cut it, she wiped the poison off the blade on to one piece
of the bird, which she gave to Statira, while she ate the
untouched portion herself. Deinon, however, says that it
was not Parysatis, but Melantas, who cut off the poisoned
part of the meat and gave it to Statira. As Statira
perished in dreadful agonies and convulsions, she herself
perceived that she had been poisoned, and directed the
suspicions of the king against his mother, knowing, as he
did, her fierce and rancorous disposition. He at once
began to search for the author of the crime, seized all his
mother’s servants and the attendants at her table, and put
them to the torture, except Gigis, whom Parysatis kept
for a long time at home with herself, and refused to deliver
up, though afterwards, when Gigis begged to be sent to
her own home, the king heard of it, laid an ambuscade,
caught her, and condemned her to death. Poisoners are
put to death in Persia in the following manner: their
heads are placed upon a flat stone, and are then beaten
with another stone until the face and skull is crushed.
Gigis perished in this manner; but Artaxerxes said and
did nothing to Parysatis, except that he sent her to Babylon,
at her own request, saying that he himself should not see
Babylon as long as she lived. Such were the domestic
troubles of Artaxerxes.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="o20"></a> Though the king was as anxious to get the Greek
troops, who accompanied Cyrus, into his power as he had
been to conquer Cyrus himself and to save his throne, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">474</a></span>yet
he could not do so: for though they had lost their leader,
Cyrus, and all their generals, yet they got away safe after
having penetrated almost as far as the king’s palace itself,
proving clearly to the world that the Persian empire, in
spite of all its gold and luxury and beautiful women, was
mere empty bombast without any real strength. Upon
this all Greece took courage and despised the Asiatics, while
the Lacedæmonians felt that it would be a disgrace to
them not to set free the enslaved Greeks of Asia Minor,
and put a stop to the insolence of the Persians. Their
army was at first commanded by Thimbron, and afterwards
by Derkyllidas, but as neither of these effected anything
of importance, they entrusted the conduct of the war to
their king Agesilaus. He crossed over to Asia with the
fleet, and at once began to act with vigour. He gained
much glory, defeated Tissaphernes, and set free the Greek
cities from the Persians. Artaxerxes, upon this, having
carefully considered how it would be best for him to
contend with the Greeks, sent Timokrates of Rhodes into
Greece with a large sum of money, and ordered him to
corrupt the most important persons in each city by offering
bribes to them, and to stir up the Greeks to make war
against Lacedæmon. Timokrates did so, and as the
greatest states formed a league, and Peloponnesus was in
great confusion, the government ordered Agesilaus to return
from Asia. On his departure on this occasion he is said
to have remarked to his friends that he was being driven
out of Asia by the King of Persia with thirty thousand
archers; for the Persian coins bear the device of an archer.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="o21"></a> Artaxerxes also chased the Lacedæmonians from
the sea, making use for this purpose of Konon, the
Athenian, as his admiral in conjunction with Pharnabazus.
Konon, after the battle of Ægospotami, had retired
to Cyprus, where he remained, not so much in order to
ensure his own safety as to watch for a favourable opportunity,
as one waits for the turn of the tide. Observing
that while he possessed skill without power, the King of
Persia possessed power without an able man to direct it,
he wrote a letter to the king expressing these ideas. He
ordered the man who carried the letter to make it reach
the king, if possible, by the hands of Zeno the Cretan, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>or
of Polykritus of Mende. Of these men, Zeno was a dancer,
and Polykritus a physician. If these men should be
absent he ordered the man to give the letter to Ktesias the
physician. It is said that Ktesias received the letter
and that he added to what Konon had written a paragraph
bidding the king send Ktesias to him, as he would be a
useful person to superintend naval operations. Ktesias,
however, says that the king of his own accord appointed
him to this service. Artaxerxes, now, by means of
Pharnabazus and Konon, gained the sea-fight of Knidos,
deprived the Lacedæmonians of the empire of the sea, and
established so great an ascendancy over the Greeks that
he was able to conclude with them the celebrated peace
which was known as the peace of Antalkidas. This
Antalkidas was a Spartan, the son of Leon; and he being
entirely in the interests of the King of Persia, prevailed
upon the Lacedæmonians to allow him to possess all the
Greek cities in Asia, and all the islands off the coast, as
his subjects and tributaries, as the result of the peace, if
that can be called a peace, which was really an insult and
betrayal of Greece to the enemy; for no war could have
ended more disgracefully for the vanquished.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="o22"></a> It follows from this that Artaxerxes, who, we
learn from Deinon, always disliked all other Spartans,
and thought them the most insolent of mankind, when
he visited Persia, showed especial favour to Antalkidas.
Once, after dinner, he took a garland of flowers, dipped it
in the most valuable perfume, and sent it to Antalkidas.
All men wondered at this mark of favour; but, it appears,
Antalkidas was just the man to receive such presents, and
to be corrupted by the luxury of the Persians, as he did
not scruple to disgrace the memory of Leonidas and Kalikratidas
by his conduct among them. When some one
said to Agesilaus, “Alas for Hellas, when the Lacedæmonians
are Medising.” Agesilaus answered “Is it not
rather the Medes that are Laconising.” Yet the cleverness
of this retort did not take away the disgrace of the
transaction, for, though the Lacedæmonians lost their
empire at the battle of Leuktra by their bad generalship,
yet the glory of Sparta was lost before, by that shameful
treaty. While Sparta was the leading state in Greece,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>
Artaxerxes made Antalkidas his guest, and spoke of him
as his friend; but when after the defeat at Leuktra the
Lacedæmonians were humbled to the dust, and were in
such distress for money that they sent Agesilaus to Egypt
to serve for hire, Antalkidas again came to the court of
Artaxerxes to beg him to help the Lacedæmonians. But
Artaxerxes treated him with such neglect, and so contemptuously
refused his request, that Antalkidas, on his
return, jeered at by his enemies, and afraid moreover of
the anger of the Ephors, starved himself to death. There
went also to the King of Persia Ismenias of Thebes, and
Pelopidas who had just won the battle of Leuktra. Pelopidas
would not disgrace himself by any show of servility;
but Ismenias, when ordered to do reverence to the king,
dropped his ring, and then stooped to pick it up, so that
he appeared to bow to the earth before him. Artaxerxes
was so much pleased with Timagoras of Athens, who gave
some secret intelligence in a letter which he sent by a
secretary named Beluris, that he gave him a thousand
darics, and, as he was in weak health and required milk
sent eighty milch cows to accompany him. He also sent
him a bed with bed-clothes and attendants to make it, as
though Greeks did not know how, and bearers to carry
him in a litter down to the sea-coast, on account of his
indisposition. When he was at court, also, the king sent
him a magnificent banquet, so that the king’s brother,
Ostanes, said to him, “Timagoras, remember this table;
for it is not for slight services that it is so splendidly set
out.” This he said rather to reproach him for his treachery
than to remind him to be grateful. However, the
Athenians put Timagoras to death for taking bribes from
the king.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="o23"></a> Although many of the acts of Artaxerxes
grieved the Greeks, yet they were delighted with one of
them, for he put to death Tissaphernes, their bitterest enemy.
This he did in consequence of an intrigue of Parysatis;
for Artaxerxes did not long continue angry with his
mother, but became reconciled with her, and sent for her
to his court, as he felt that her understanding and spirit
would help him to govern, while there remained no further
causes of variance between them. Henceforth she endeavoured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">477</a></span>
in everything to please the king, and gained
great influence with him by never opposing any of his
wishes. She now perceived that he was violently
enamoured of one of his own daughters, named Atossa,
but that, chiefly on his mother’s account, he concealed his
love and restrained himself, though some historians state
that he had already had some secret commerce with the
girl. When Parysatis suspected this, she caressed the girl
more than ever, and was continually praising her beauty
and good qualities to the king, saying that she was a
noble lady and fit to be a queen. At last she persuaded
him into marrying the girl and proclaiming her as his
lawful wife, disregarding the opinions and customs of the
Greeks, and declaring that he himself was a law to the
Persians and able to decide for himself what was right
and wrong. Some writers, however, amongst whom is
Herakleides of Kyme, state that Artaxerxes, besides
Atossa, married another of his daughters, named Amestris,
of whom I shall shortly afterwards make mention. Atossa
lived with her father as his wife, and was so much beloved
by him, that when leprosy broke out over her body he was
not at all disgusted with her, but prayed for her to Hera
alone of all the goddesses, prostrating himself in her
temple and grasping the earth with his hands, while he
ordered his satraps and friends to send so many presents to
the goddess, that all the space between the palace and the
temple, a distance of sixteen stadia (two English miles)
was filled with gold and silver, and horses, and purple
dyed stuffs.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="o24"></a> He appointed Pharnabazus and Iphikrates to
conduct a war against Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_584_584">584</a> which failed through the
dissensions of the generals; and he himself led an army of
three hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse
against the Kadousians.<a id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_585_585">585</a> On this occasion he insensibly
placed himself in a position of great peril as he entered a
difficult and foggy country, which produces no crops that
grow from seed, but is inhabited by a fierce and warlike
race of men who feed upon apples, pears, and other fruits
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>which are found upon trees. No provisions could be
found in this country, nor yet be brought into it from
without, and the army was reduced to slaughtering the
beasts of burden, so that an ass’s head sold for more than
sixty drachmas. The king’s own table was scantily
furnished; and but few of the horses remained alive, all
the rest having been eaten. At this crisis Teribazus,
a man who had often made himself the first man in the
state by his bravery, and as often fallen into disrepute by
folly, and who was then in a very humble and despicable
position, saved both the king and his army. The
Kadousians had two kings, each of whom occupied a
separate camp. Teribazus, after having explained to
Artaxerxes what he was about to do, himself went to one
of these camps, and sent his son to the other. Each of
them deceived the king to whom he went, by saying that
the other king was about to send an embassy to Artaxerxes,
offering to make peace and contract an alliance with him
for himself alone. “If, then, you are wise,” said they,
“you will be beforehand with your rival, and I will
manage the whole affair for you.” Both of the kings
were imposed upon in this manner, and, in their eagerness
to steal a march upon one another, one of them sent
ambassadors to the Persians with Teribazus, and the other
with his son. As Teribazus was a long while absent,
Artaxerxes began to suspect his fidelity, and he fell into
a very desponding condition, regretting that he had trusted
Teribazus, and listening to his detractors. When, however,
Teribazus arrived, and his son arrived also, each bringing
ambassadors from the Kadousians, and a treaty of peace was
concluded, Teribazus became again a great and important
personage. In this campaign Artaxerxes proved that
cowardice and effeminacy arise only from a depraved
disposition and natural meanness of spirit, not, as the
vulgar imagine, from wealth and luxury; for in spite of the
splendid dress and ornaments, valued at twelve thousand
talents, which he always wore, the king laboured as hard,
and suffered as great privations, as any common soldier,
never mounting his horse, but always leading the way on
foot up steep and rugged mountain paths, with his quiver
on his shoulder, and his shield on his left arm, so that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>all
the rest were inspirited and encouraged by seeing his
eagerness and vigour; for he accomplished every day a
march of upwards of two hundred stadia.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="o25"></a> When during cold weather the army, encamped
in a royal domain, which was full of parks and fine trees,
while all the rest of the country was bare and desert, he
permitted the soldiers to gather wood from the royal
park, and gave them leave to cut down the trees, without
sparing either fir trees or cypresses. As they hesitated,
and wished to spare the trees because of their size and
beauty, he himself took an axe and cut down the largest
and finest tree of all. After this they provided themselves
with wood, lighted many fires, and passed a comfortable
night.</p>
<p>On his return from this campaign he found that he had
lost many brave men, and almost all his horses. He
fancied that he was regarded with contempt because of
his failure, and began to view all the great men of the
kingdom with suspicion. Many of them he put to death
in anger, but more because he feared them—for fear makes
kings cruel, while cheerful confidence renders them
gentle, merciful, and unsuspicious. For this reason, the
beasts that start at the least noise are the most difficult
to tame, while those which are of a more courageous spirit
have more confidence and do not shrink from men’s
advances.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="o26"></a> Artaxerxes, who was now very old, perceived
that his sons were caballing with their friends and with
the chief nobles of the kingdom to secure the succession.
The more respectable of these thought that Artaxerxes
ought to leave the crown to his eldest son Darius, as he
himself had inherited it, but Ochus his younger son, who
was of a vehement and fierce disposition, had a very considerable
party, who were ready to support his claims, and
hoped to be able to influence his father by means of
Atossa; for he paid her especial attention, and gave out
that he intended to marry her and make her his queen
after his father’s death. It was even said that he intrigued
with her during his father’s life. Artaxerxes knew
nothing of this: but as he wished to cut off the hopes of
Ochus at once, for fear that he might do as Cyrus <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span>had
done, and again plunge the kingdom in wars and disorders,
he proclaimed Darius his heir, and allowed him to wear his
tiara erect. There is a custom among the Persians that
whoever is declared heir to the throne may ask for anything
that he pleases, and that the king who has
nominated him must, if possible, grant his request.
Darius, in accordance with this custom, asked for Aspasia,
the favourite of Cyrus, who was at that time living in
the harem of Artaxerxes. This lady was a native of the
city of Phokæa in Ionia, born of free parents, and respectably
brought up. When she was introduced to Cyrus at
supper, with several other women, the others sat down
beside him, permitted him to touch them and sport with
them, and were not offended at his familiarities, but she
stood in silence near the couch on which Cyrus reclined,
and refused to come to him when he called her. When
his chamberlains approached her, meaning to bring her to
him by force, she said, “Whoever lays hands on me shall
smart for it.” The company thought her very rude and
ill-mannered, but Cyrus was pleased with her spirits, and
said, with a smile, to the man who had brought her, “Do
you not see that this is the only ladylike and respectable
one of them all.” After this he became much attached to
her, loved her above all other women, and used to call her
“Aspasia the wise.” When Cyrus fell and his camp was
plundered she was taken prisoner.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="o27"></a> Now, Darius vexed his father by asking for
this lady; for the Persians are excessively jealous about
their women; indeed, not only all who approach and speak
to one of the king’s concubines, but even any one who
drives past or crosses their litters on the high road, is
punished with death. Yet, Artaxerxes, through sheer
passion, had made Atossa his wife, and kept three hundred
most beautiful concubines. However, when Darius made
this request, he replied that Aspasia was a free
woman, and said that if she was willing he might take
her, but that he would not force her to go against her
will. When she was sent for, as she, contrary to the
king’s expectation, chose to go to Darius, the king let her
go, for the law compelled him to do so, but he soon afterwards
took her away from him again: for he <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>appointed
her priestess of the temple of Artemis, called Anäitis, at
Ekbatana, in order that she might spend the rest of her
life in chastity. This he considered to be not a harsh, but
rather a playful way of reproving his son; but Darius was
much enraged at it, either because he was so deeply
enamoured of Aspasia, or because he thought that he was
being wantonly insulted by his father. Teribazus, perceiving
his anger, confirmed him in it, because he saw in
the treatment which Darius had received the counterpart
of that which had befallen himself. The king, who had
several daughters, promised Apama to Pharnabazus,
Rhodogoune to Orontes, and Amestris to Teribazus. He
kept his word with the two former, but broke it to
Teribazus by marrying Amestris himself, and betrothing
his youngest daughter Atossa to him in her stead. When,
as has been related, he fell in love with her also and
married her, Teribazus became bitterly enraged against
him, being of an unstable and fickle disposition, without
any steady principles. For this reason he never could
bear either bad or good fortune, but at one time he was
honoured as one of the greatest men in the kingdom, and
then swaggered insufferably, while when he was disgraced
and reduced to poverty he could not bear his reverse of
fortune with a good grace, but became insolent and
offensive.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="o28"></a> It may be imagined that the company of
Teribazus was to Darius as fuel to fire, for Teribazus was
constantly repeating to him that it was of no use for him
to wear his tiara upright if he did not mean to advance
his own interests, and that he was a fool if he imagined
that he could inherit the crown without a struggle when
his brother was bringing female influence to bear to
secure his own succession, and when his father was in
such a vacillating and uncertain frame of mind. He who
could break the laws of the Persians—which may not be
broken—out of his passion for a Greek girl, cannot be
urged, be trusted, to keep the most important engagements.
It was, moreover, a very different thing for Ochus
not to obtain the crown, and for him to be deprived of
it, for there was no reason why Ochus should not live
happily in a private station, whereas he, having <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">482</a></span>been
appointed heir to the throne, must either become king
or perish.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, perhaps we may say with Sophocles,
“Swift runneth evil counsel to its goal,” for men find the
path smooth and easy towards what they desire, and
most men desire what is wrong, because of their ignorance
and low mindedness. Yet, besides all these considerations,
the greatness of the empire, and the fear with which
Ochus inspired Darius, also afforded arguments to Teribazus.
Nor was the goddess of Love entirely blameless
in the matter, for Darius was already incensed at the loss
of Aspasia.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="o29"></a> He, therefore, placed himself entirely in the
hands of Teribazus; and many joined in their conspiracy.
But the plot was betrayed to the king by a eunuch, who
had a perfect knowledge of their plans, and knew that
they had determined to break into the king’s chamber by
night and murder him in his bed. When Artaxerxes
heard this he was perplexed; for he felt that it would be
wrong for him to neglect the information which he had
received of so great a danger, and yet that it would be
even worse to believe the eunuch’s story without any
proofs of its truth. He therefore ordered the eunuch to
join the conspirators, and to enter his chamber with them.
Meanwhile he had a door made in the wall behind his bed,
and concealed it with tapestry. When the appointed time
arrived, of which he was warned by the eunuch, he lay
upon his bed, and did not rise before he had seen the faces
of the conspirators and clearly recognised each of them.
But when he saw them draw their daggers and rush upon
him, he quickly raised the tapestry, passed into the inner
room, and slammed the door, crying aloud for help. The
would-be murderers, having been seen by the king, but having
effected nothing, rushed away through the gates of the
palace, and especially warned Teribazus to fly, as he had
been distinctly seen. The others dispersed and escaped,
but Teribazus was surrounded, and after killing many of
the king’s body guard with his own hand was at last
despatched by a javelin hurled from a distance. Darius
and his children were brought before a court formed of
the royal judges, who were appointed by the king to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">483</a></span>try
him. As the king himself did not appear but impeached
him by proxy, he ordered clerks to write down the
decision of each judge and to bring it to him. As all
decided alike, and sentenced Darius to death, the officers
of the court removed him into a prison hard by. The
executioner now came, bearing in his hand the razor, with
which the heads of criminals are cut off, but when he saw
Darius he was dismayed, and ran back to the door with his
face averted, declaring that he could not and dared not
lay hands upon his king. As, however, he was met
outside by the judges, who threatened him and ordered
him to do his duty, he returned, took hold of Darius’s hair
with his left hand, dragged down his head, and severed
his neck with the razor. Some historians state that the
king himself was present at the trial, and that Darius,
when proved guilty, fell on his face and begged for mercy:
at which the king sprung up in anger, drew his dagger,
and stabbed him mortally. They add that Artaxerxes,
after he had returned to his palace, came forward publicly,
did obeisance to the sun, and then said aloud, “Men of
Persia, be of good cheer, and go, tell the rest of my subjects
that the great Oromasdes has executed judgment upon
those who formed a wicked and treasonable plot.”</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="o30"></a> This was the end of the conspiracy; and now
Ochus was encouraged by Atossa to form high hopes,
though he still feared his remaining legitimate brother
Ariaspes, and his natural brother Arsames. The Persians
wished Ariaspes to be their king, not because he was older
than Ochus, but because he was of a gentle and kind disposition;
while Ochus observed that Arsames was of a
keen intellect, and was especially beloved by his father.
He, therefore, plotted against both of them, and as he was
by nature both crafty and cruel, he indulged his cruelty in
his treatment of Arsames, while he made use of his cunning
to ruin Ariaspes. He kept sending to this latter eunuchs
and friends of the king, who, with an affection of secrecy,
continually told him frightful tales of how his father had
determined to put him to death with every circumstance
of cruelty and insult. These messengers, by daily communicating
these fabrications to him, saying that the
king was on the very eve of carrying them into operation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">484</a></span>
threw the unhappy man into such a terrible state of despair
and excitement of mind that he ended his life by
poison. The king, on hearing of the manner of his death,
lamented for him, and had some suspicions about how he
came by his end; but as he was unable to verify them and
discover the truth, on account of his great age, he attached
himself all the more warmly to Arsames, so that he was well
known to trust and confide in him above all others. Yet,
Ochus was not discouraged by this, but finding a suitable
instrument in Arpates the son of Teribazus, induced him
to assassinate Arsames. Artaxerxes, when this happened,
was so old that his life hung by a mere thread; and when
this last blow fell, he could bear up no longer, but sunk
at once through grief and misery. He lived ninety-four
years, and reigned sixty-two, and was thought to be a mild
prince, and a lover of his subjects, though this was chiefly
because of his successor, Ochus, who was the most savage
and cruel tyrant that ever ruled in Persia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF ARATUS.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="p1"></a> It seems to me, my Polykrates, that it was in order to
avoid the ill-omened sound of the old proverb, that the
philosopher Chrysippus altered it into what he thought
a better version:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Who vaunt their fathers, save the best of sons?”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>but Dionysodorus of Trœzene proves him to be wrong, and
restores the proverb to its original form:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Who vaunt their fathers, save the worst of sons?”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>and explains that the proverb was intended to apply to
those who are utterly worthless in themselves, but who
shelter their own evil lives behind the virtues of their
ancestors, and who pride themselves on their ancestors’
glory as though it were their own. Yet, in one who, like
yourself, “by birth inherits glory from a noble race,” as
Pindar has it, and who, as you do, imitates in his own life
the noblest examples of his ancestry, may well take pleasure
in discoursing upon the lives of well-born men, and
in listening to the remarks of others about them. They
do not depend for praise upon the lives of other men,
because there is nothing to be admired in themselves, but
they combine the glory of their ancestors with their own,
and honour them both as having founded their families
and as having set examples to be imitated. For this
reason I have sent to you the life of Aratus, which I have
compiled, not that I was not aware that you had carefully
studied all his achievements and were well acquainted
with them, but with the hope that your sons, Polykrates
and Pythokles, might be brought up to imitate the glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span>
example of their forefathers, and might learn to walk
in their footsteps by reading and discussing the history of
their exploits. Indeed, to imagine that one has already
arrived at perfection, argues self-conceit rather than true
greatness of character.</p>
<p>II.<a id="p2"></a> The city of Sikyon, as soon as it lost its original
oligarchic Dorian constitution, became distracted by internal
faction, and at last fell into the hands of a series of
despotic rulers. After the last of these, named Kleon, had
been put to death, the citizens placed the government in
the hands of Timokleides and Kleinias, two of their most
honourable and influential men. But as soon as a settled
form of government began to be established, Timokleides
died, and Abantidas, the son of Paseas, in order to obtain
the supreme power for himself, assassinated Kleinias,
and either banished or put to death all his relatives and
friends. He endeavoured to kill Kleinias’s son, Aratus,
who was left an orphan at the age of seven; however,
during the confusion which prevailed in the house, the
child wandered out into the city, and, terrified and helpless,
made his way unnoticed into the house of Soso, Abantidas’s
sister, whose husband was Prophantus, the brother
of Kleinias. She was naturally a high-souled lady, and
thought also that the child must have been directed by
heaven to take refuge in her house. She hid him from his
enemies, and that night sent him away to Argos.</p>
<p>III.<a id="p3"></a> This adventurous escape from so terrible a danger
produced in the mind of Aratus the fiercest hatred of all
despots. He was brought up by his father’s friends at
Argos in a manner becoming his birth, and as he grew up
tall and strong, he devoted himself to gymnastic exercises
in the palaestra, and even gained a crown for success in
the pentathlum. We can trace the effects of this training
in his statues, which represent an intellectual and commanding
countenance, and also the effects of the liberal
diet and work<a id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_586_586">586</a> with the spade practised by the professional
athlete. For this reason he paid less attention
to oratory than became a public man; yet he was a better
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>speaker than some suppose, which is proved by the study
of his hastily and plainly-written memoirs.</p>
<p>As time went on, Deinias and Aristotle the logician
formed a plot against Abantidas, who was accustomed to
come and spend his leisure time in the open market-place
with them, listening to their discourse and arguing with
them. They drew him into a discussion and assassinated
him. He was succeeded by his father, Paseas, who was
soon treacherously slain by Nikokles, who now declared
himself despot of Sikyon. We are told that this man was
singularly like Periander, the son of Kypselus, just as the
Persian Orontes bore a striking resemblance to Alkmæon,
the son of Amphiaraus, and a certain young Spartan so
closely resembled Hector, that he was trampled to death
by the multitudes who came to see him and satisfy their
curiosity.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="p4"></a> Nikokles reigned four months, during which time
he did the city much hurt, and very nearly lost it to the
Aetolians, who had formed a plot to surprise it. Aratus
was now nearly grown up, and possessed great influence,
both on account of his noble birth, and because he was
already well known to be possessed of an enterprising
spirit, combined with a prudence beyond his years. In
consequence of this, all the other Sikyonian exiles looked
upon him as their leader, and Nikokles himself regarded
him with apprehension, and quietly took precautions
against him, never supposing that he would attempt so
audacious an enterprise as he did, but thinking he would
probably make overtures to some of the successors of
Alexander, who had been guests<a id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_587_587">587</a> and friends of his father.
Indeed, Aratus did attempt to obtain assistance from some
of them; but since Antigonus, though he promised his
aid, temporised and hesitated to act, and his hopes from
Egypt and Ptolemy were too remote, he determined to
overthrow the despot alone.</p>
<p>V.<a id="p5"></a> The first persons to whom he communicated his
design were Aristomachus and Ekdelus, of whom the
former was an exile from Sikyon, while Ekdelus was an
Arcadian of Megalopolis, a man of culture as well as of
action, who had been an intimate friend of Arkesilaus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">488</a></span>Academic philosopher at Athens. As both these men
readily accepted his proposals, Aratus began to discuss the
project with the other exiles. Some few felt ashamed to
abandon all hope of restoration to their country, and joined
Aratus, but most of them tried to hinder him from making
the attempt, alleging that his daring was the result of
inexperience. While Aratus was meditating whether he
could not seize some strong place within the territory of
Sikyon, and make it the base of his operations against the
despot, there came to Argos a certain Sikyonian who had
escaped from prison. This man was the brother of Xenokles,
one of the exiles; and when brought to Aratus by
his brother, told him that the city wall, at the place where
he himself climbed over it and made his escape, was very
nearly level with the ground on the inside, as it was built
up against high and rocky ground, while on the outside it
was not so high as to be beyond the reach of scaling-ladders.
Aratus, when he heard this, sent Xenokles with two of his
own servants, named Seuthas and Technon, to reconnoitre
the spot, for he was determined, if possible, to risk everything
by one sudden and secret assault, rather than openly
to engage in what might prove a long and tedious war,
waged, as it would be by a private man against the despotic
ruler of a state. Xenokles, on his return, reported
that he had measured the height of the walls, and that
the ground presented no difficulties for their attempt, but
he said that it would be difficult to reach the place unobserved,
because of the dogs of a gardener who dwelt near,
which, though small, were peculiarly ferocious and savage.
Upon hearing this, Aratus at once began to prepare for the
attempt.</p>
<p>VI.<a id="p6"></a> The use of arms was, at that period, familiar to all
men, because of the constant marauding incursions which
each state continually made upon the territory of its neighbours.
The scaling-ladders were made openly by Euphranor
the carpenter, one of the exiles, whose trade enabled
him to construct them without exciting suspicion.</p>
<p>The Argive friends of Aratus each contributed ten men
from their own households; while he himself was able to
arm thirty slaves of his own. He also hired from Xenokrilus,
the well-known captain of robbers, a small band <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">489</a></span>of
soldiers, who were told that the object of the incursion
into the Sikyonian territory was to carry off some horses
belonging to King Antigonus. Most of the band were
ordered to make their way in scattered parties to the tower
of Polygnotus, and there to wait for their leaders. Kaphisias,
in light marching order, with four others, was sent on
in advance, with instructions to present himself at the
house of the gardener about nightfall. Under the pretext
of being wayfaring men seeking for hospitality, they were
to obtain lodgings there for the night, and secure both the
man and his dogs, for unless this was done it would be
impossible to reach the walls. The scaling-ladders, which
were made to take to pieces, were packed in chests, covered
over, and sent forward in waggons. Meanwhile, as several
spies sent by Nikokles had appeared in Argos, who were
said to be quietly watching the movements of Aratus, he
rose at daybreak, and spent the day in the open market-place,
conversing with his friends. Towards evening he
anointed himself in the palæstra, and then went home,
taking with him several of the companions with whom he
was accustomed to drink and amuse himself. Soon after
this his servants were seen crossing the market-place, one
carrying garlands, another buying torches, and another
bargaining with the female musicians who were wont to
attend at banquets. The spies, seeing all these preparations,
were deceived and laughingly said to one another,
“Surely there is nothing more cowardly than a tyrant, if
Nikokles, with such a city and armed force at his disposal,
really fears this youth, who wastes the income on which
he has to subsist in exile, on amusements and on wine
parties before it is even dark.”</p>
<p>VII.<a id="p7"></a> Thus the spies were thrown off their guard; but
Aratus, immediately after supper, sallied forth, met his
men at the tower of Polygnotus, and led them to Nemea
where he explained, to most of them for the first time, what
he was about to attempt. After promising them rewards
in case of success, and addressing to them a few words of
encouragement, he gave Propitious Apollo as the watchword,
and proceeded towards the city, regulating his
march according to the moon, so that he was able to make
use of its light to march by, and when it was <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">490</a></span>setting
arrived at the garden outside the walls. Here Kaphisias
met him, with the news that he had not been able to
secure the dogs, which had run away, but that he had
locked up the gardener in his house. On hearing this
most of the conspirators became disheartened, and demanded
to be led back again; but Aratus pacified them by
promising that, if the dogs attacked them and gave the
alarm, he would give up the attempt. He now sent forward
a party with the scaling-ladders, under the command
of Ekdelus and Mnesitheus, and himself proceeded at a
leisurely pace. The dogs at once set upon the party under
Ekdelus, and kept up a continuous barking; nevertheless
they reached the wall and placed the ladders against it undisturbed.
While the foremost were mounting, the officer
who was being relieved by the morning guard passed that
way carrying a bell, and there was a great flashing of
lights and trampling of marching soldiers. The conspirators
remained where they were, crouching upon their
ladders, and without difficulty escaped the notice of this
patrol, but they were terribly near being discovered by a
second body of guards marching in the opposite direction.
As soon as this also had passed by without noticing them,
the leaders, Mnesitheus and Ekdelus, at once mounted
upon the walls, secured the passage along the walls both
on the right and on the left, and despatched Technon to
Aratus, bidding him hasten to the spot.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="p8"></a> At no great distance from the garden there stood
a tower upon the walls, in which a great hound was kept
for a watch. This hound had not noticed the approach of
the escalading party, either because he was dull of hearing,
or because he was tired with exercise the day before.
When, however, the gardener’s little dogs roused him by
their clamour at the foot of the wall, he at first set up a
low growling, and then, as the party drew nearer, began
to bark furiously. He made so much noise that the
sentry on the next tower called out in a loud voice to the
huntsman in charge of the dog, asking him at what
the hound was barking so savagely, and whether anything
was wrong. The huntsman replied from his tower
that all was well, only that the hound had been disturbed
by the lights of the patrol and the sound of their bell.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">491</a></span>
This gave great encouragement to Aratus’s party, who
imagined that the huntsman spoke thus because he had
seen them and wished to screen them from observation and
assist their plot, and that many others in the city might
be willing to do the same. Yet, the scaling of the walls
was a long and dangerous operation, as the ladders were
too weak to bear the weight of more than one man
mounting slowly at a time, yet time pressed, for the cocks
had already begun to crow, and soon the country people
might be expected to arrive, bringing their wares to market.
So, now, Aratus, himself hastily mounted, after forty of his
men had reached the top, and while the remainder were
still mounting, he marched straight to the despot’s
house, and the guard-room in which his mercenary troops
passed the night. By a sudden assault he took them
all prisoners without killing one of them, and at once
sent messengers to summon his own friends from their
houses. Day was breaking while they assembled, and
soon the theatre was filled with an excited crowd without
any distinct idea of what was happening, until a herald
came forward and announced to the people that Aratus,
the son of Kleinias, invited his fellow-citizens to regain
their liberty.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="p9"></a> The people now, at last, believed that their long-looked-for
deliverers had indeed come, and rushed in a
body to set fire to the despot’s house. The burning house
made such a prodigious blaze that it was seen as far as
Corinth, where the citizens were so much astonished, that
they were within a little of setting out to rescue Sikyon
from the flames. Nikokles himself escaped by a subterranean
passage, and got clear away from the city, and his
soldiers, with the assistance of the citizens, put out the
fire and plundered his house. Aratus did not attempt to
stop this proceeding, and distributed the remainder of
the despot’s treasure among the citizens. No one was
killed or wounded, either of the attacking or defending
party, but by good fortune this great exploit was accomplished
without spilling a drop of blood. Aratus now
restored the citizens whom Nikokles had banished, who
were eighty in number, and also those who had been
driven into exile by his predecessors, who amounted to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">492</a></span>no
less than five hundred. These latter had been forced
to wander from place to place for a period of nearly
fifty years. They now returned, very poor for the most
part, and at once laid claim to the property which had
once been theirs. Their attempts to gain possession of
their houses and lands caused the greatest disquietude to
Aratus, who saw the city plotted against from without,
and viewed with dislike by Antigonus on account of its
free constitution, while within it was full of faction and
disturbance. Under these circumstances he did what he
thought was best, by making the city a member of the
Achæan league: and the people of Sikyon, Dorians as
they were, willingly adopted the name and entered into
the confederacy of the Achæans, who at that time were
neither famous nor powerful. Most of them dwelt in small
towns, and their territory was both confined and unproductive,
while the sea-shore, near which they lived, was
without harbours, and for the most part exposed to a
terrible surf. Yet these men, more than any others,
proved that Greeks are invincible wherever they are collected
into regularly organised communities, and with a
capable general to lead them. They were but an insignificant
fraction of the mighty Greece of former times, and
had not altogether the strength of one single considerable
city; yet, by wise counsel and agreement among themselves,
and by following and obeying their greatest man,
instead of being jealous of his power, they not only preserved
their own liberties, although surrounded by so many
powerful cities and despots, but were constantly able to
assist the rest of the Greeks in recovering and defending
their freedom.</p>
<p>X.<a id="p10"></a> Aratus was by nature a politician, and was of a magnanimous
disposition, more careful of the interests of the
state than of his own. He regarded all despots with a
peculiarly rancorous hatred, but in respect to other persons,
made his personal likes and dislikes subordinate to
the good of his country. For this reason his zeal for his
friends does not appear to have been so remarkable as his
mild and forgiving treatment of his enemies; for he regulated
his private feelings entirely by considerations of
public expediency. He loved to form alliances <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">493</a></span>between
states, to connect cities into confederations, and to teach
the leaders and the people alike to act together with
unanimity. Singularly timid and faint-hearted in open
war and in battles fought by daylight, he nevertheless was
most dexterous at planning surprises, winning cities, and
overthrowing despots. For this reason he often succeeded
in his rashest enterprises, and often, through excessive
caution, failed when success would have been comparatively
easy. Some wild animals see best in the dark, and are
nearly blind during the daytime, because the moist nature
of their eyes cannot endure the dry and searching rays of
the sun; and so, too, it appears that some men lose their
courage and are easily disconcerted when they are fighting
openly in broad daylight, but yet recover all their bravery
as soon as they engage in secret stratagems and midnight
surprises. These anomalies must be attributed to a want
of philosophic reflection in noble minds, which effect great
things naturally, and without acting by rule or method,
just as we see good fruit produced by wild and uncultivated
trees. I will now proceed to prove this by
examples.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="p11"></a> Aratus, after he had joined himself and his native
city to the Achæan league, served in the cavalry force,
and made himself generally beloved by the ready obedience
which he showed to his commanders; for he, although he
had rendered the league such important services in putting
his own illustrious name and the power of the city of
Sikyon at its disposal, yet, as if he were a mere private
man, obeyed whoever might be in command, even though
he were a citizen of Dyme, or of Tritæa, or even some more
insignificant city. Aratus was now presented with the
sum of five-and-twenty talents by the king.<a id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_588_588">588</a> This he
received, but spent it all on relieving his destitute fellow-countrymen,
and in ransoming them from slavery.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="p12"></a> As the returned exiles could not be withheld from
attacking those whom they found in possession of their
property, and by doing so seemed likely to bring the state
to ruin, Aratus, thinking that nothing but the kindness of
Ptolemy could save his country, started upon a voyage to
Egypt, to beg the king to furnish him with a sum of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">494</a></span>money, by means of which he might persuade the contending
parties to come to an amicable agreement. He
started from the port of Mothone, and sailed beyond Cape
Millea, meaning to cross directly over the sea to Egypt.
However, the sea was very rough, and the wind contrary,
which, caused the captain of the ship to bear up, and run
along the coast until, with great difficulty, he reached
Adria,<a id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_589_589">589</a> which was an enemy’s country, for it was in the
possession of Antigonus, who had placed a Macedonian
garrison in it. Aratus contrived to keep out of the way
of the garrison, and, leaving the ship, proceeded a long
way inland, accompanied by one single friend, named
Timanthes. They concealed themselves in a thick wood,
and passed the night as best they could. Shortly afterwards
the Macedonian officer in charge appeared, and endeavoured
to find Aratus, but was put off the scent by the
slaves of Aratus, who had been instructed to say that their
master, as soon as he left them, had sailed in another
vessel bound to Eubœa. However, the Macedonian declared
the cargo, the vessel, and the slaves to be a lawful
prize, as being enemy’s property, and detained them as
such. A few days after this, when Aratus was almost at
his wit’s end, by good fortune a Roman ship touched at the
place where he was spending his time in looking out for
means of escape by sea, and in trying to conceal himself
from his enemies on land. The ship was bound for Syria,
but Aratus would not sail in it until he had persuaded the
captain to land him in Karia. On his voyage thither he
again encountered great dangers: but at length he succeeded
in obtaining a passage from Karia to Egypt, where
he was warmly received by the king, who had always had
a favourable opinion of him, and who had lately received
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">495</a></span>from him many drawings and paintings by Greek artists.
Aratus, who had considerable taste in these matters, constantly
purchased and collected the works of the most
skilful and famous painters, especially those of Pamphilus
and Melanthus, and used to send them as presents to
King Ptolemy.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="p13"></a> At that time the Sikyonian school of painting was
still celebrated throughout Greece, and was thought more
than any other to have preserved the purity of the ancient
style. Even the great Apelles, when already famous, had
come to Sikyon and paid a talent for some lessons from
the masters there, although by doing so he hoped to
increase his reputation rather than to improve his art.
When Aratus set the city free, he at once destroyed all
the portraits<a id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_590_590">590</a> of the despots, except that of Aristratus,
who flourished in the time of Philip,<a id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_591_591">591</a> about which he
hesitated for a long time; for the picture in which
Aristratus was represented standing beside the chariot
which won him a prize in the games, was the joint work
of all the pupils of Melanthus, and we are told by
Polemon the geographer, that some parts of it were painted
by Apelles himself. The execution was so admirable that
Aratus for a moment relented, but soon afterwards his
fierce hatred of all the despots made him order it to be
destroyed. However, Nealkes the painter, who was a
friend of Aratus, interceded for the picture with tears, and
as he could not move Aratus, at last said, “We ought to
make war against despots themselves, but not against their
surroundings. Let us leave the chariot and the figure of
Victory, and I will deliver up Aristratus to you, by wiping
him out of the picture.” Aratus allowed Nealkes to do
this, and he effaced the figure of Aristratus, and painted
a palm tree in its place, without venturing to add anything
else. It is said that after destroying the figure of
Aristratus, the painter forgot his feet, and that they were
still to be seen under the chariot. By presents of such
paintings as these Aratus had already disposed Ptolemy to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">496</a></span>regard him with favour; and when they met, Aratus so
charmed the king by his conversation that he received
from him a present of one hundred and fifty talents for the
use of his native city. Aratus carried forty talents home
with him at once to Peloponnesus, and afterwards received
the rest of the sum in instalments from the king.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="p14"></a> It was a truly great action for Aratus to bestow so
much money upon his fellow-countrymen, especially at a
time when for much smaller sums the kings were usually
able to bribe the other chiefs and popular leaders to betray
their native cities and sacrifice their constitutional liberties;
but it was even more admirable that by means of this
money he reconciled the rich and the poor, and saved the
state from all the danger of revolution, while his own
conduct was marked by the greatest moderation in spite
of his enormous power. When he was appointed as sole
arbitrator with unlimited authority, to decide upon the
claims of the exiled families to their inheritances, he refused
to act alone, and associated fifteen of the other citizens
with himself, with whose help, after much labour and
difficulty, he restored peace and union amongst his countrymen.
For these services the state bestowed upon him
fitting honours, but in addition to these the exiles gave
him a special mark of their regard by erecting a brazen
statue, upon which was inscribed the following verses:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“For wisdom, valour, and great deeds in war</div>
<div class="line">Thy fame, Aratus, has been noised afar.</div>
<div class="line">We, that unhappy exiles were of late,</div>
<div class="line">Brought home by thee, this statute dedicate</div>
<div class="line">To all the gods who helped thee to restore</div>
<div class="line">Peace and goodwill amongst us as before.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>XV.<a id="p15"></a> By this important measure Aratus so thoroughly
earned the gratitude of his countrymen as to be placed
above the reach of party jealousy; but King Antigonus
was much displeased at his success, and with the object
either of making him his friend, or of causing him to be
distrusted by Ptolemy, bestowed upon him several marks
of favour, and when sacrificing to the gods at Corinth even
sent some of the meat of the victim to Sikyon as a present
for him. At dinner that evening he said aloud in the
hearing of many guests: “I thought this young <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>Sikyonian
was merely a well-bred and patriotic youth; but it seems
that he is a very shrewd judge of the lives and politics of
us kings. At first he used to despise me, and looked
beyond me to Egypt, because he had heard so much about
the elephants and fleets of Ptolemy, and about the
splendour of his court, but now that he has been admitted
behind the scenes there and has discovered it to be all empty
show and parade, he has thrown himself into my arms
without reserve. So now I receive the youth into my own
service, and shall employ him in all my affairs; and I beg
you all to treat him as a friend.”</p>
<p>All those who were jealous of Aratus and who wished
him ill, as soon as they heard these words, vied with one
another in sending letters to Ptolemy, full of abuse of
Aratus, until at length Ptolemy himself wrote to Aratus
and reproached him for his disloyalty. So much jealousy
and ill-feeling does the friendship of kings produce among
those who most eagerly struggle to gain it.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="p16"></a> Aratus, who was now for the first time elected
general of the Achæans, invaded and plundered the
countries of Kalydonia and Lokris on the other side of the
Corinthian gulf, but though he marched with ten thousand
men to help the Bœotians he came too late to take part in
the battle, in which they were defeated near Chæronea by
the Ætolians. In this battle a thousand Bœotians perished,
amongst whom was Aboeokritus the Bœotarch himself.
Next year Aratus was again chosen general, and began to
arrange his plot for the capture of the Akrocorinthus, or
citadel of Corinth. He made this attempt not to benefit
the Achæans, or his own city of Sikyon, but solely with
the object of driving out the Macedonian garrison, which
was established there as the common despot over all Greece.
The Athenian Chares, after gaining some success in battle
over the generals of the King of Persia, sent home a despatch
to the Athenian people in which he declared that he
had won the sister victory to that of Marathon: and this
exploit of Aratus may be most truly described as sister to
those of Pelopidas the Theban and of Thrasybulus the
Athenian, in which they each killed the despots of their
respective cities; except that this assault was not delivered
against Greeks, but against a foreign and alien sovereignty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">498</a></span>
Now the isthmus, which bars out the two seas, connects
together the two parts of our continent; but the Acrocorinthus,
which is a lofty mountain placed in the middle
of Greece, if it be held by an armed force, cuts off the land
beyond the isthmus from all intercourse with the rest of
Greece, whether for warlike or commercial purposes, and
places the whole country at the mercy of the commander
of its garrison; so that the younger Philip was not in jest
but in earnest when he called the city of Corinth the “key
of Greece.”</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="p17"></a> The possession of this place was always coveted
by all princes and rulers, but the desire of Antigonus for
it became a frantic passion, and his whole thoughts were
occupied with plots to obtain it by stratagem, since it was
hopeless to attempt to take it by force. After the death
of Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_592_592">592</a> who originally held it, and who, it is said,
was poisoned by Antigonus, his wife Nikæa succeeded to
his kingdom, and held the Acrocorinthus. Antigonus now
at once sent his son Demetrius to her, and by holding out
the dazzling prospect of a royal alliance and a handsome
young husband to a woman somewhat past her prime,
made a conquest of her by means of his son, whom he employed
without scruple to tempt his victim. As, however,
she would not give up the citadel, but kept it strongly
guarded, Antigonus pretended to be indifferent to it, and
prepared a wedding feast in Corinth, spending the whole
day in attendance at spectacles and in wine-drinking, as if
he had entirely given himself up to pleasure and enjoyment.
When the time drew near for the attempt, he himself
accompanied Nikæa to the theatre to hear Amœbeus
sing. They were carried together in royal state in a
splendidly ornamented litter, and she was delighted at the
respect which he showed her, and was as far as possible
from guessing his real purpose. When they arrived at the
point where the road turned off towards the citadel, he
begged her to proceed alone to the theatre, and without
troubling himself further about Amœbeus or the marriage,
ran up to the Acrocorinthus faster than one would have
expected in a man of his age. Finding the gate shut, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>knocked at it with his stick, bidding the garrison open it;
and they, astounded at his audacity, threw it open. When
he had thus obtained possession of the place he could no
longer restrain himself, but although he was now an old
man, and had experienced great vicissitudes of fortune, he
drank wine and jumped for joy in the streets, and swaggered
riotously across the market-place, crowned with flowers,
and accompanied by singing-girls, greeting and shaking
hands with every one whom he met. So true it is that
unexpected joy disturbs the right balance of the mind
more than either grief or terror.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="p18"></a> Now Antigonus, having, as above related,
gained possession of the Acrocorinthus, entrusted the
place to some of his most faithful officers, among whom
was Persæus the philosopher. Aratus, during the life of
Alexander, had begun to form a plan for surprising the
citadel, but desisted from his plot when Alexander became
an ally of the Achæans. He now began to form fresh
schemes, in the following manner:—There were in Corinth
four brothers, Syrians by birth, one of whom, named
Diokles, was serving in the garrison, and quartered in the
citadel. The other three, having robbed the king’s
treasury, came to Sikyon to dispose of the plunder to a
banker named Ægias, who was well known to Aratus
from having had dealings with him. They disposed of a
considerable part of their plunder at first, and afterwards,
one of them, named Erginus, came quietly over from
time to time with the remainder. In this way he became
intimate with Ægias, and, being led on by him to talk
about the citadel, said that when going up the hill to visit
his brother, he had noticed a narrow path on one side,
which led to the lowest part of the wall of the fortress.
On hearing this, Ægias laughingly said to him, “My good
sir, why do you rob the king’s treasury to gain such
pitiful sums of money, when you might gain great riches
in a single hour? Do you not know that burglary and
treachery are alike punished with death?” Erginus
smiled at this, and agreed to sound his brother Diokles
upon this point; for he could not, he said, place much
confidence in the other two.</p>
<p>In a few days he returned, undertook to lead Aratus <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">500</a></span>to
a part of the wall which was not more than fifteen feet
high, and arranged that both he and his brother Diokles
would do all in their power to assist him.</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="p19"></a> Aratus promised that he would give them sixty
talents if successful, and that, in case of failure, if he and
they survived, he would give each of them a house and a
talent. As the money had to be deposited with Ægias
for the satisfaction of Erginus, Aratus, who did not possess
the sum necessary, and who did not wish to lead
others to suspect his design by borrowing, took the greater
part of his own plate and his wife’s jewels, and pledged
them with Ægias for the money. Indeed, he was of so
lofty a soul, and so passionately desirous of glory, that
although he knew that Phokion and Epameinondas had
gained the reputation of being the most just and noble of
the Greeks, by refusing large bribes and not sacrificing
honour to money, he preferred to expend his fortune
secretly in enterprises in which he alone risked his life on
behalf of the many, who did not even know what he was
doing. Who, even in our own day, could refrain from
admiring and longing to share the fortunes of a man who
bought for himself so great a danger at so high a price,
and who pawned the most valuable of his possessions in
order that he might make his way into the fortress of his
enemies by night and fight for his life there, gaining by
his deposit the hope of glory, but nothing else?</p>
<p>XX.<a id="p20"></a> The plot, dangerous enough in itself, was rendered
even more so at its very outset by a blunder. Technon,
the servant of Aratus, was sent to examine the wall
together with Diokles. He had never before met Diokles,
but imagining that he knew his appearance from Erginus’s
description of him as a man with close curly hair, a dark
complexion, and no beard, went to the rendezvous, and
waited outside the city, near the place called Ornis, for
Erginus, who was to meet him there with his brother
Diokles. In the meantime the brother of Erginus and
Diokles, named Dionysius, who was not in the plot, and
knew nothing of what was going on, happened to come up.
He was very like Diokles, and Technon, influenced by the
likeness, inquired of him if he were in any way connected
with Erginus. As he answered that he was his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>
Technon was quite certain that he was addressing Diokles;
and without asking his name or waiting for any further
proof of identity he gave him his hand, spoke of the compact
with Erginus, and asked him questions about it. He
cleverly encouraged Technon in his error, agreed to everything
that he said, and, turning round, walked with him
towards the city without exciting his suspicions. When
he was close to the gate, and had all but inveigled Technon
through it, it chanced that Erginus met them. Perceiving
the trick which his brother had played, and the danger in
which Technon was placed, he warned him by a sign to
make his escape, and both of them, running away at full
speed, got safe back to Aratus. Yet he did not despair,
but at once sent Erginus to take some money to Dionysius,
and to beg him to hold his tongue. Erginus accomplished
his commission, and brought Dionysius back with him to
Aratus. When he arrived there they would not let him
go again, but kept him a close prisoner, while they themselves
prepared to make the attempt.</p>
<p>XXI.<a id="p21"></a> When all was ready, Aratus ordered the greater
part of his force to pass the night under arms, and himself
with a chosen body of four hundred men, few of whom
were in the secret, proceeded towards the gates of Corinth,
near the temple of Hera. The time was the height of
summer. The moon was at the full, and as the night
was clear and cloudless, they began to fear that the light
gleaming from their arms would betray them to the
sentinels. However, when the leading men were near to
the wall a fog came up from the sea, and enveloped the
whole city and its neighbourhood. Now, the men all sat
down and took off their shoes; for men who mount ladders
with naked feet make very little noise and are not so liable
to slip. Meanwhile Erginus, with seven youths dressed
as wayfaring men, made his way up to the gate unsuspected.
They killed the keeper of the gate, and the
guard: while at the same time the scaling-ladders were
placed against the walls. Aratus hastily crossed the walls
with a hundred men. Bidding the remainder follow as
fast as they could, he ordered the ladders to be drawn up,
and, followed by his hundred men, ran through the town
to the citadel, overjoyed at having got so far without <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>raising
an alarm, and already certain of success. While they
were still some distance off, they met a patrol of four men
carrying a light. These men could not see them because
they were in the shadow of the moon, but the four men
were clearly visible as they marched straight towards
them. Aratus now drew his force a little aside among
some ruins and low walls, so as to form an ambush, and
set upon the men. Three were killed on the spot, but the
fourth, though wounded in the head by a blow from a
sword, ran away shouting that the enemy were within the
walls. Soon after this trumpets were sounded, the whole
city was disturbed, and all the streets became thronged
with men running to and fro, while many lights appeared,
some in the lower town, and some in the citadel above,
and a confused murmur of voices was heard on every
side.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="p22"></a> While this was going on, Aratus persevered in
his march, and was toiling laboriously up the cliff. At first
he proceeded slowly and with difficulty, without making
any real progress, because he had entirely missed the path,
which wound about under the shadow of the precipitous
rocks by many turnings and windings up to the citadel.
At this moment it is said that the moon shone through
the clouds and threw her light upon the most difficult
part of the ascent in a wonderful manner, until Aratus
reached the part of the wall of the citadel which he wished
to attack. When he was there, she again concealed and
shaded her rays behind a barrier of clouds. While this
was being done, the three hundred men of Aratus’s force,
who had been left outside the gate near the temple of Hera,
when they made their way into the city, which was now
full of confusion and lights, were not able to find the same
path which had been followed by the others, or any trace of
the way by which they had gone, and so in a body crouched
down in a dark corner in the shade of a cliff, and waited
there in great anxiety and alarm: for now the party led
by Aratus was being shot at by the garrison of the citadel,
and was fighting with them hand to hand, and the shouts
of the battle could be plainly heard below, though the
echoes of the mountains made it impossible to tell from
what quarter the noise proceeded. While they were at <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">503</a></span>a
loss to know which way to turn, Archelaus, the leader of
the Macedonian troops, marched out with a large force,
with loud shouts and trumpets sounding, to attack the
party under Aratus, and marched past where the three
hundred lay as it were in ambush. They rushed out,
charged the Macedonians, killed the first of them, and drove
Archelaus and the remainder before them panic-stricken,
until they dispersed themselves about the city. No sooner
had this victory been won, than Erginus arrived from the
citadel, announcing that Aratus was engaged with the
enemy, who were offering a stubborn resistance, that a great
battle was going on at the wall itself, and that immediate
assistance was required. They at once bade him lead
them, and mounted the hill, shouting to their friends to
let them know who they were, and to encourage them.
The full moon, too, as it shone upon their arms, made their
numbers appear greater to the enemy on account of the
length of the path, and the midnight echoes made their
shouts appear to come from a much larger party of men.
At last they joined their friends above, and by a united
effort drove out the enemy, won the heights, and gained
possession of the citadel just as day was dawning. Soon
the sun rose upon their victory, and the remainder of
Aratus’s force from Sikyon came up, and was welcomed
by the Corinthians, who opened their gates to them, and
assisted them to capture the soldiers of the Macedonian
garrison.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="p23"></a> When all appeared to be safe, Aratus descended
from the citadel to the theatre, where an enormous multitude
of persons was collected, eager to see him and
to hear the speech which he was about to address to the
Corinthians. He placed a guard of Achæans on each side
of the stage, and himself appeared in the middle, still
wearing his corslet, and pale with the labours of a sleepless
night, so that the triumph and delight which he felt were
weighed down by sheer bodily lassitude. His appearance
was greeted with enthusiastic applause, and, shifting his
spear into his right hand, and slightly leaning his body
against it, he stood for a long time silent, receiving the
plaudits and shouts of those who praised his courage and
congratulated him on his good fortune. When they <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>had
ceased and resumed their seats, he drew himself up and
made them a speech worthy of the occasion, on behalf of
the Achæan league, in which he prevailed upon the
Corinthians to join the league, and gave up to them the
keys of their gates which now came into their possession
for the first time since the days of king Philip. He
dismissed Archelaus, who had been taken prisoner, but
put Theophrastus to death because he refused to leave his
post. Persæus, when the citadel was taken, escaped to
Kenchreæ. Afterwards it is said that in philosophic conversation,
when some one said that he thought that the
philosopher was the only true general, he answered, “By
heaven, this once used to please me more than any other
of Zeno’s aphorisms, but I have changed my mind since the
refutation of it which I received from a young man of
Sikyon.” This anecdote of Persæus is related by most
historians.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="p24"></a> Aratus now at once made himself master of the
temple of Hera, and of Lechæum, where he seized a fleet
of five-and-twenty ships belonging to King Antigonus, and
sold five hundred horses and four hundred Syrians whom
he found there. The Achæans now garrisoned the citadel
of Corinth with a force of four hundred heavy-armed
soldiers, and with a pack of fifty hounds and as many
huntsmen, who were all kept in the citadel.<a id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_593_593">593</a></p>
<p>The Romans in their admiration of Philopœmen used to
call him the last of the Greeks, as though no great actions
were performed in Greece after his time: but I should be
inclined to say that this was both the last and the most
remarkable of all the great achievements of the Greeks, for
both in the daring with which it was accomplished, and the
good fortune with which it was attended, it will bear
comparison with the noblest of deeds, as was at once
proved by its results. Megara revolted from Antigonus
and joined Aratus, Troezene and Epidaurus became
members of the Achæan league, and Aratus made his first
campaign by an expedition into Attica, in the course of
which he crossed into Salamis and laid it waste, being
able to make what use he pleased of the power of the
Achæan league, now that it was no longer, as it were,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">505</a></span>locked up in Peloponnesus. He sent back all the freemen
whom he captured to Athens without ransom, hoping to
rouse them to revolt against the Macedonians. He also
brought Ptolemy into alliance with the Achæan league,
and constituted him commander-in-chief of their forces by
land and by sea. His influence with the Achæans was so
great, that, since it was illegal to elect him as their chief
every year, they elected him every other year, while
practically they followed his advice in all their transactions;
for they saw that he preferred neither wealth, nor
fame, nor the friendship of kings, nor the advantage of
his own native country to the furtherance of the
prosperity of the Achæans. He conceived that cities
which by themselves were weak might obtain safety by
means of one another, bound together by their common
interest, and that just as the various parts of the human
body live and move when connected with one another,
but waste away and perish when cut asunder, so cities are
ruined by isolation, and prosper by confederation, when
they form parts of one great body, and adopt a common
line of policy.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="p25"></a> Observing that the most famous of the neighbouring
cities were independent, he became grieved that
the Argives lived under the rule of a despot, and began to
plot the destruction of Aristomachus, their ruler; wishing
also to bestow its freedom upon the city to which he owed
his education, and to gain it over to the Achæan league.
Men were found who dared to make the attempt, chief
among whom were Æschylus and Charimenes the soothsayer,
but they had no swords, because the despot had
prohibited the possession of arms to the citizens under
severe penalties. However, Aratus prepared at Corinth a
number of small daggers, which he caused to be sewn up
in pack-saddles. He then placed the saddles on pack-horses
and sent them to Argos, laden with ordinary
merchandise.</p>
<p>But Charimenes the soothsayer took another person into
the plot, which so enraged Æschylus and his party that
they determined to act alone, and would have nothing
more to do with Charimenes. In anger at this treatment
he betrayed his comrades just as they were on the point <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>of
attacking the despot, yet most of them had time to make
their way out of the market-place and escape to Corinth.
Shortly afterwards Aristomachus was assassinated by his
own servants, and was immediately succeeded by Aristippus,
a more cruel tyrant than himself. Aratus upon
hearing of this at once made a hurried march to Argos at
the head of as many Achæans as he could collect, hoping to
find the city ready to join him. As, however, most of the
Argives were now accustomed to the loss of their liberty,
and no one answered his appeal, he retired, having done
no more than expose the Achæans to the charge of making
a warlike invasion in time of peace. For this they were
tried before the Mantineans as judges, and, as Aratus did
not appear, Aristippus, who was prosecutor, won his cause
and got a fine of thirty minæ laid upon the Achæans. As
he both hated and feared Aratus himself, he now, with the
connivance of King Antigonus, endeavoured to have him
assassinated; and they soon had their emissaries everywhere,
watching their opportunity. There is, however, no such
certain safeguard for a ruler as the love of his people; for
when both the masses and the leading men have learned
not to fear their chief, but to fear for him, he sees with
many eyes, hears with many ears, and soon gains intelligence
of any conspiracies. And in this place I wish to stop
my narrative for a moment, and describe the mode of life
which Aristippus was compelled to lead in consequence of
being a despot, and possessing that position of absolute
ruler which men are wont so greatly to admire and
envy.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="p26"></a> Aristippus had Antigonus for his ally, kept a
large force on foot for his own protection, and left none of
his enemies alive in the city of Argos. He used to make
his body-guard and household troops encamp in the
porticoes outside his palace, and always, after supper, sent
all his servants out of the room, locked the door himself,
and betook himself with his mistress to a little upper
chamber which was reached by a trapdoor, upon which
he placed his bed and slept, as one may expect, a disturbed
and frightened sleep. His mistress’s mother used to take
away the ladder by which they mounted, and lock it up in
another room. At daybreak she used to bring it <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">507</a></span>back
again, and call down this glorious monarch, who came out
like a snake out of his den.</p>
<p>Aratus, who dressed in the plainest of clothes, and was
the declared enemy of despots wherever they were to be
found, gained for himself a lasting command, not by force
of arms, but by legal means by his own courage, and has
left a posterity which even at the present day enjoys the
greatest honour in Greece; whereas of all those men who
seized strongholds, kept body-guards, and protected their
lives with arms and gates and trapdoors, few escaped being
knocked on the head like hares, and no one has left either
a palace, or a family, or a monument to do honour to his
memory.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="p27"></a> Aratus made many attempts, both by intrigues
and open violence, to overthrow Aristippus, and take
Argos. Once he succeeded in placing scaling-ladders
against the walls, ascended them recklessly with a few
followers, and killed the soldiers who came from within
the city to oppose him. Afterwards, when day was
breaking and the troops of the despot were attacking him
on all sides, the people of Argos, just as if they were
sitting as judges at the Nemean games, and the battle was
not being fought on behalf of their liberty, sat by with
the utmost calmness, like impartial spectators. Aratus
fought bravely, and though wounded in the thigh by a
spear, yet succeeded in effecting a lodgement in the city
and in spite of the attacks of the enemy held his ground
until nightfall. If he could have found strength to remain
and fight during the night also, he would not have failed
in his attempt; for the despot was already making
preparations for flight and had sent on much of his property
to the sea-coast: but as no one brought news of this
to Aratus, and water failed him, while his wound incapacitated
him for any personal exertions, he drew off his forces.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="p28"></a> He now gave up this method of attack, and
openly invaded the Argive country with an army and laid
it waste. At the river Chares he fought a desperate
battle with Aristippus, and was thought to have given up
the contest too soon, and lost the victory; for when the
other part of his army had decidedly won the day and
forced their way a long distance forward, he himself, not <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">508</a></span>so
much overpowered by the forces opposed to him as hopeless
of success and fearing disaster, lost his presence of
mind, and led his men back into their camp. When the
others returned from their victorious charge, and complained
bitterly that, after having routed the enemy, and
slain many more men than they themselves had lost, Aratus
had allowed the vanquished to erect a trophy, he was stung
to the quick, decided to fight rather than to allow the
trophy to be erected, and after an interval of one day again
led out his forces. When, however, he learned that the troops
of the despot had been largely reinforced, and were full of
confidence, he did not venture to risk a battle, but made a
truce for the recovery of the dead, and retired. Yet he
continued to repair this fault by his diplomatic skill and
persuasive powers, for he won over the city of Kleonæ to
the Achæan league, and held the Nemean festival at Kleonæ,
declaring it to be the privilege of its citizens to do so by
right of descent. The Argives also celebrated the festival,
and on this occasion for the first time the right of safe-conduct
of the competitors was violated, for the Achæans
seized and sold for slaves all who passed through their
territory on their return from the games at Argos. So stern
and inexorable was Aratus in his hatred of despots.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="p29"></a> Shortly after this, hearing that Aristippus was
meditating an attack upon Kleonæ, but feared him, because
he was living at Corinth, he ordered an army to be mustered.
Bidding his men collect provisions for several days, he
marched as far as Kenchreæ, hoping to draw out Aristippus
to attack Kleonæ during his absence, as indeed happened.
Aristippus at once came from Argos with his entire force;
but Aratus meanwhile returned by night to Corinth from
Kenchreæ, and, having placed guards upon all the roads,
led the Achæans by so swift, well-managed, and orderly a
march, that while it was still dark he not only reached
Kleonæ, but drew up his men in order of battle before
Aristippus discovered their presence. At daybreak the
city gates were thrown open, and charging with loud
shouts to the sound of the trumpet, he at once routed the
enemy, and pursued in the direction in which he thought
Aristippus most probably was fleeing, the country being
full of ways to escape pursuit. The chase was kept <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">509</a></span>up
as far as Mykenae, where the despot was overtaken
and slain by a Cretan named Tragiskus, according to the
historian Deinias. With him fell more than fifteen hundred
of his men. Yet, Aratus, after gaining such a brilliant
success without losing one of his own soldiers, did not take
Argos or restore it to liberty, as Agias and Aristomachus
the younger marched into the town with some Macedonian
troops and seized the government.</p>
<p>However, by this action, Aratus pretty well silenced the
ill-natured joke, which had been made about himself, and the
stories, invented by the courtiers of despots; for they
described the general of the Achæans as being subject to
violent internal disorders during a battle, and said that as
soon as the trumpeter appeared he became faint and dizzy,
and that, after having arrayed his forces, given the word,
and inquired of his lieutenants and officers whether they
had any further need of his presence, when the die was
finally cast, he used to retire and await the result at a
distance. These stories had such an extensive currency,
that even philosophers in their studies when discussing
whether violent beating of the heart, changing of colour,
and the like in time of danger be a mark of cowardice or of
distemperature and of a cold habit of body, always mention
Aratus as being a good general, but always being affected
in this manner when in battle.</p>
<p>XXX.<a id="p30"></a> When he had slain Aristippus, he at once began
to plot against Lydiades of Megalopolis, who had made
himself despot of his native city. Lydiades was naturally
of a noble and ambitious nature, and had not, like so many
despots, been led to commit the crime of enslaving his fellow-citizens
by any selfish desire of money or of pleasure;
but when a young man he had become inflamed with a
desire of distinguishing himself, and listening to all the
vain and untrue talk about despotic power being so fine
and happy a thing, he, like a high-spirited youth, made
himself despot, and soon became overwhelmed with the
cares of state. As he now both envied the happiness of
Aratus and feared the results of his plots, he adopted a
new and most glorious course, which was first to set himself
free from hatred and terror and soldiers and life-guards,
and next to become the benefactor of his country. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">510</a></span>sent
for Aratus, gave up his rule, and united the city to the
Achæan league. The Achæans admired his conduct in this
matter so much that they elected him general. He now
at once began to strive to outdo Aratus in glory, and engaged
in many unnecessary enterprises, one of which was
a campaign against the Lacedæmonians. Aratus opposed
him, and was therefore thought to be jealous of him;
yet Lydiades was a second time elected general, in spite of
the open opposition of Aratus, who used all his influence on
behalf of another candidate. Aratus himself, as has been
said, was general every other year. Lydiades continued
in the full tide of success and was elected general alternately
with Aratus up to his third year of office; but as
he made no secret of his hatred for Aratus, and often
attacked him in the public assembly of the Achæans, they
cast him off and would not listen to him, thinking that
his good qualities were but counterfeit when compared
with the genuine virtues of Aratus. Just as Æsop tells
us in his fables that when the cuckoo asked the little birds
why they fled from him, they answered that some day he
would be a hawk, so it seems that, even after he had given
up his despotism, some blighting suspicion always clung to
the character of Lydiades.</p>
<p>XXXI.<a id="p31"></a> Aratus gained great glory also in the Ætolian
war, because when the Achæans were eager to join battle
with the Ætolians on the Megarian frontier, and Agis the
King of Lacedæmon had arrived with a large force and
urged the Achæans to fight, he opposed it, and in spite of
being reproached, abused, and jeered at as a coward,
refused to be led astray by any high-flown ideas of honour
from the course which he had decided upon as the best,
made way for the enemy, and without striking a blow
permitted them to cross Geranea and pass into Peloponnesus.
When, however, they marched by him and suddenly
seized Pellene, he was no longer the same man. He would
not wait until his entire force was assembled, but with what
troops he had with him at once marched against the enemy,
who, after their victory, were easily conquered on account
of their want of discipline and licentiousness. As soon as
they made their way into the city of Pellene, the soldiers
dispersed themselves among the various houses, driving <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">511</a></span>each
other out of them and fighting one another for the plunder,
while the chiefs and generals were occupied in carrying off
the wives and daughters of the citizens. They took off their
own helmets and placed them on the heads of these women,
in order that no one else might take them, but that the owner
of each one might be known by the helmet which she wore.
While they were thus engaged the news suddenly came
that Aratus was about to attack. A panic took place, as
one might readily expect, with such want of discipline, and
before all of them heard of the danger, the foremost, meeting
the Achæans near the gates and suburbs of the city, lost
heart and fled away at once, and in their frantic haste threw
into disorder those who were forming to come to their
support.</p>
<p>XXXII.<a id="p32"></a> During this tumult one of the captive women,
the daughter of an eminent citizen named Epigethus,
who herself was remarkably tall and handsome, happened
to be sitting in the temple of Artemis, where she had been
stationed by the commander of a picked company of
soldiers, who had placed upon her head his own helmet
with its triple plume. She, hearing the disturbance,
suddenly ran out, and as she stood at the door of the
temple, looking down upon the combatants, with the triple-plumed
helmet upon her head, she appeared even to her
own countrymen to be something more glorious than a
mere mortal, while the enemy, who imagined that they
beheld an apparition, were struck with terror and affright,
so that none of them attempted to offer any resistance.
The people of Pellene themselves say that the wooden
statue of the goddess is never touched except when it is
carried out by the priestess, and that then no one dares to
look upon it, but all turn their faces away; for the sight
of it is not only fearful and terrible for mankind, but it
even makes the trees barren and blights the crops through
which it is carried. This it was, they say, which the
priestess carried out of the temple on this occasion, and
by continually turning the face of the figure towards the
Ætolians, made them frantic and took away their reason.
Aratus, however, in his memoirs makes no mention of
anything of the kind, but says that he routed the
Ætolians, broke into city together with the fugitives, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">512</a></span>and
killed seven hundred of them. The exploit became celebrated
as one of his most glorious actions, and the artist
Timanthes has painted an admirable picture of the battle.</p>
<p>XXXIII.<a id="p33"></a> However, as many nations and princes were
combining together against the Achæans, Aratus at once
made peace with the Ætolians, and with the assistance of
Pantaleon, the most powerful man in Ætolia, even made
an alliance between that country and the Achæans. He
was anxious to set free the Athenians, and was severely reproached
by the Achæans because, during a cessation of
arms, when they had made a truce with the Macedonians,
he attempted to seize Peiræus. In the memoirs which he
has left Aratus denies this, and throws the blame of it upon
Erginus, with whose aid he seized the citadel of Corinth.
This man, he says, attacked Peiræus on his own responsibility,
and when the scaling-ladder broke and he was
forced to fly, frequently called on Aratus by name as
though he were present, and by this artifice deceived the
enemy and escaped. This justification does not, however,
seem a very credible one. There was no probability that
Erginus, a private man and a Syrian, should have ever
thought of such an enterprise, if he had not been urged
to it by Aratus, who must have supplied him with the
necessary forces and pointed out the proper opportunity
for the attack. And Aratus himself proves this to be true
by having not merely twice or thrice, but frequently, like
a rejected lover, made attempts upon Peiræus, and not
being disconcerted by his failures, but ever gathering
fresh hopes by observing how nearly he had succeeded.
On one of these occasions he sprained his leg in a hasty
retreat across the Thriasian plain. Several incisions had
to be made to cure it, and he was obliged for a long time
to be carried in a litter when conducting his campaigns.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<a id="p34"></a> When Antigonus died and Demetrius<a id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_594_594">594</a> succeeded
to the throne, Aratus was more eager than ever to
gain over Athens, and began to treat the Macedonians
with contempt. When he was defeated in a battle which
he fought against Bithys, a general of Demetrius, and
many rumours were current that he had been taken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">513</a></span>prisoner or had been slain, Diogenes, the commander of
the garrison of Peiræus, sent a letter to Corinth bidding
the Achæans leave that city now that Aratus was dead.
When this letter arrived Aratus himself was present in
Corinth, and the messengers of Diogenes had to return
after having afforded him much amusement. The King of
Macedonia also sent a ship, on board of which Aratus was
to be brought back to him in chains. But the Athenians,
outdoing themselves in levity and servility to the Macedonians,
crowned themselves with garlands when they
heard the news of his death. Enraged at this Aratus
at once invaded their country, and marched as far as
the Academy, but there he suffered his anger to be appeased,
and did no damage. The Athenians did, nevertheless, appreciate
his courage, for when on the death of Demetrius,
they attempted to regain their freedom, they invited him
to assist them. Although Aratus was not at that time
general of the Achæans, and was confined to his bed with
a long illness, yet he responded to this appeal by proceeding
to Athens in a litter, and prevailed upon Diogenes, the
chief of the garrison, to surrender Peiræus, Munychia,
Salamis, and Sunium to the Athenians for the sum of one
hundred and fifty talents, twenty of which he himself contributed.
The states of Ægina, and Hermione now joined the
Achæan league, and the greater part of Arcadia contributed
to it; for the Macedonians were engaged in wars with their
neighbours, and the Achæans, with the help of their
allies, the Ætolians, now gained a large accession of force.</p>
<p>XXXV.<a id="p35"></a> Aratus was still true to his original principles,
and, grieving at the spectacle of a despotism established
in the neighbouring state of Argos, sent to Aristomachus,
and endeavoured to persuade him to give up his authority,
bring the city over to the Achæan league, and imitate
Lydiades by becoming the glorious and respected general
of so great a people rather than remain exposed to
constant danger as the hated despot of one city. Aristomachus
acceded to these proposals of Aratus, but asked
him for the sum of fifty talents, for the payment of the
mercenaries whom he was to disband. While the money
was being procured, Lydiades, who was still in office as
general, and wished to gain the credit of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">514</a></span>negotiation
for himself, told Aristomachus that Aratus was really the
bitter and implacable foe of all despots, persuaded him
to intrust the management of the affair to himself, and
introduced Aristomachus to the Achæan assembly. On
this occasion the Achæan representatives gave Aratus a
notable proof of their love and confidence in him; for
when he indignantly opposed the proposition they drove
away Aristomachus; and yet, when Aratus had become
his friend and again brought forward the matter, they
readily accepted his proposal, admitted the cities of Argos
and Phlius into the league, and the following year
elected Aristomachus general. Aristomachus, finding
himself cordially received by the Achæans, and wishing
to invade Laconia, sent for Aratus from Athens. Aratus
replied by a letter in which he dissuaded him from
making this campaign, being unwilling to involve the
Achæans in hostilities with Kleomenes, who was a bold
general and had already gained surprising successes. As,
however, Aristomachus was determined to begin the war,
Aratus returned, and made the campaign with him. When
near Pallantium they met Kleomenes, and Aratus was
reproached by Lydiades for restraining Aristomachus from
joining battle. The year after, Lydiades stood against
Aratus as a candidate for the office of general, when
Aratus was chosen general for the twelfth time.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<a id="p36"></a> During this term of office Aratus was defeated
by Kleomenes near Mount Lykaeum, and took to flight.
He lost his way during the night, and was supposed
to have fallen. The same rumours now again ran through
Greece about him; but he got safely away, and having
rallied his men was not satisfied with retiring home unmolested,
but making an admirable use of his opportunity,
as no one expected an attack, he suddenly fell upon the
Mantineans, who were the allies of Kleomenes. He took
the city, placed a garrison in it, and insisted on the resident
foreigners being admitted to the franchise, thus alone
gaining for the Achæans after a defeat, a success which
they could hardly have obtained by a victory. When the
Lacedæmonians marched against Megalopolis, Aratus came
to the assistance of that city. He would not fight with
Kleomenes, though the latter endeavoured to entice <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515">515</a></span>him
into a battle, but he kept back the men of Megalopolis
who were eager to fight; for he was at no time well-fitted
for the direction of pitched battles, and on this occasion
was inferior in numbers, besides being opposed to a young
and daring antagonist, while he himself was past the
prime of life, and inclined to fail in spirit. He thought,
too, that while it was right for Kleomenes to gain glory
by daring, it was best for him to be careful to keep the
glory which he had already obtained.</p>
<p>XXXVII.<a id="p37"></a> Though the light-armed troops ran out to
meet the Spartans, drove them back to their camp, and
even fought round their tents, yet Aratus would not move
on with the heavy-armed force, but halted them behind a
water-course which he forbade them to cross. Lydiades,
irritated at this, reproached Aratus, called upon the cavalry
to follow him and reinforce the victorious light troops,
and not to lose the victory or desert him when he was
fighting for his country. Many brave men joined him,
and with them he charged the right wing of the enemy,
overthrew them, and pursued with reckless ardour until
he became entangled in difficult ground, full of fruit trees
and wide ditches, where he was attacked by Kleomenes,
and fell fighting bravely in the noblest of causes, at the
very gates of his native city. His companions fled back to
the main body, where they disordered the ranks of the
hoplites, and brought about the defeat of the entire army.
Aratus was greatly blamed, because he was thought to
have left Lydiades to perish. The Achæans angrily retired
to Ægium, and forced him to accompany them. There
they held a meeting, at which it was decided that he
should not be supplied with any money nor any mercenary
troops maintained for him, but that if he wished to go to
war he must furnish them for himself.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<a id="p38"></a> After being thus disgraced, Aratus determined
at once to give up the seals<a id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_595_595">595</a> and lay down his office
of general, but after consideration he put up with the affront
led out the army of the Achæans, and fought a battle with
Megistonous, the step-father of Kleomenes, in which he was
victorious, slew three hundred of the enemy, and took
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">516</a></span>prisoner Megistonous himself. He had hitherto been always
elected general every other year, but now, when the time
for his election came round, he refused to take the office,
although pressed to do so, and Timotheus was chosen
general. It was thought that his anger with the people
was merely a pretext for his refusal, and that the real reason
was the perilous situation of the Achæan league; for Kleomenes
no longer operated against it by slow degrees as
before, when he was embarrassed by the other Spartan
magistrates, but now that he had put the Ephors to death,
redistributed the land, and admitted many of the resident
aliens to the franchise, he found himself an irresponsible
ruler at the head of a large force, with which he at
once assailed the Achæans, demanding himself to be acknowledged
as their chief. For this reason Aratus has been
blamed for behaving like a pilot during a terrible storm and
tempest yielded up the helm to another when it was his duty
to stand by it, even against the will of the people, and save
the commonwealth; or, if he despaired of the Achæans being
able to resist, he ought to have made terms with Kleomenes
and not to have allowed Peloponnesus to fall back into the
hands of the uncivilised Macedonians and be occupied by
their troops, and to have garrisoned the citadel of Corinth
with Illyrian and Gaulish soldiers, thus inviting into the
cities, under the name of allies, those very men whom he
had passed his life in out-manœuvring and over-reaching,
and whom in his memoirs he speaks of with such hatred.
Even if Kleomenes were, as some might call him, a despot
and a law-breaker, yet Sparta was his native country, and
the Herakleidæ were his ancestors, and surely any man
who respected Greek nobility of birth would have chosen
the least illustrious of such a family for his chief rather
than the greatest man in all Macedonia. Moreover,
Kleomenes, when he asked the Achæans to appoint him as
their ruler, promised that in return for that title he would
do great things for them by land and sea, whereas Antigonus,
when offered the title of supreme ruler by land and sea,
would not accept it until he received the citadel of Corinth
as a bribe, exactly like the huntsman in Æsop’s fable;
for he would not mount upon the backs of the Achæans,
though they begged him to do so, and offered <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">517</a></span>themselves
to him by embassies and decrees, before, by means of his
garrison in Corinth and the hostages which he received, he
had, as it were, placed a bit in their mouths.</p>
<p>Aratus makes a laboured defence of his conduct, pleading
the necessities of his situation. Yet Polybius tells us that
long before any such necessities existed, Aratus had felt
alarm at the daring spirit of Kleomenes, and had not only
been carrying on secret negotiations with Antigonus, but
even had urged the people of Megalopolis to propose to
the Achæans that Antigonus should be invited to assist
them. It was the people of Megalopolis who were the greatest
sufferers by the war, as Kleomenes constantly ravaged
their territories. The historian Phylarchus gives a similar
account of the transaction, though we could hardly receive
his narrative with confidence if it were not supported by
the testimony of Polybius; for he is so enthusiastic an admirer
of the character of Kleomenes that in his history he
writes as though he were pleading his cause in a court of
justice, and continually disparages Aratus, and, vindicates
Kleomenes.</p>
<p>XXXIX.<a id="p39"></a> The Achæans now lost Mantinea, which was
recaptured by Kleomenes, and they were so dispirited by
a great defeat, which they sustained near Hekatombæon,
as to send at once to Kleomenes, inviting him to come to
Argos and assume the supreme command. Aratus, as soon
has he learned that Kleomenes had set out, and was marching
past Lerna at the head of his army, became alarmed,
and sent an embassy to him, begging him, to come to the
Achæans as to friends and allies, with only three hundred
men, and offering hostages to him, if he suspected them of
treachery. Kleomenes regarded this message as a mockery
and an insult to himself. He immediately retired, after
writing a letter to the Achæans in which he brought
many grave charges against Aratus. Aratus, in turn,
wrote several letters to them assailing Kleomenes; and
they abused one another so outrageously as not even to
spare the reputation of each other’s wives. After this,
Kleomenes sent a herald to declare war against the
Achæans, and very nearly succeeded in making himself
master of Sikyon by the treachery of some of its citizens.
Failing in this, he turned aside, attacked Pellene, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">518</a></span>drove
out the commander, and took the city. Shortly afterwards
he took Phenes and Penteleum. Upon this the Argives at
once joined him, and the citizen of Phlius admitted a
Spartan garrison: so that the Achæans seemed to be in
danger of losing all their conquests, and Aratus became
seriously alarmed at the disturbed condition of the
Peloponnesus, for he saw that in every quarter cities,
encouraged by revolutionary agitators, were preparing
to throw off their allegiance to the league.</p>
<p>XL.<a id="p40"></a> None were quiet or satisfied with things as they
were, but many citizens of Corinth and of Sikyon itself
openly corresponded with Kleomenes, and expressed the
disaffection which they had long felt to the league, and
their wish to obtain the supreme power for themselves.
In dealing with these persons, Aratus took the law into
his own hands and put to death all Sikyonians whom he
found corrupted; but when he attempted to seek out and
punish the Corinthian conspirators, he enraged the populace
which already was disaffected, and weary of the Achæan
domination. The people ran together to the temple of
Apollo, and sent for Aratus, being determined either to kill
him or take him prisoner, before they proceeded openly
to revolt from the league. Aratus appeared before them,
leading his horse, without betraying any suspicion or
alarm, and when many of them leaped up and showered
abusive language upon him, he, with an admirable composure
of countenance and manner, quietly bade them be
seated, and not stand up talking loudly and confusedly
but let in also those who were outside the gates. While
speaking thus he retired at a foot’s pace, as though he
were looking for some one to take care of his horse. By
this means he got away from them and proceeded on his
way, talking unconcernedly to all the Corinthians whom
he met, whom he bade go to the temple of Apollo, until he
came near to the citadel. Here he sprang upon his horse’s
back, gave orders to Kleopater, the commander of the
garrison, to hold the place stoutly, and rode away to
Sikyon, followed by only thirty soldiers, as the rest had
all remained behind and dispersed.</p>
<p>After a short time the Corinthians discovered that he had
taken to flight, and pursued, but as they could not <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">519</a></span>overtake
him, they sent to Kleomenes and delivered up their city
to him. Yet Kleomenes considered that he had lost more
by the escape of Aratus than he had gained by the acquisition
of Corinth. Kleomenes was at once joined by the
inhabitants of the sea-side district known as Akte, who
surrendered their cities to him, and with their assistance
he completely invested the citadel of Corinth with a rampart
and palisade.</p>
<p>XLI.<a id="p41"></a> Aratus was joined at Sikyon by the representatives
of most of the cities of the Achæan league. An assembly
was held, at which he was elected general, with unlimited
powers. He now surrounded himself with a body-guard
selected from among his fellow-citizens. Aratus had
conducted the affairs of the league for thirty-three years,
during which he had made himself the first man in Greece,
both in power and in renown, though now he was utterly
ruined and cast down, forced to cling to his native city
as his only chance of safety amidst the general wreck of
his fortunes. For the Ætolians refused to help him when
he implored their aid, and Eurykleides and Mikion held
back the Athenians from offering any assistance, though
they were eager to do so out of regard for Aratus. Aratus
had a house at Corinth and some property, which Kleomenes
refused to touch, or to let any one else meddle with, but
sent for Aratus’s friends and those whom he had left in
charge of his property, and bade them keep everything in
good order, as they would have to answer to Aratus for
their conduct. Kleomenes also sent Tripylus and his uncle
Megistonous to Aratus to negotiate with him, promising
him among many other advantages a yearly pension of
twelve talents, thus over-bidding Ptolemy by one half:
for Ptolemy paid Aratus six talents a year. Kleomenes
proposed that he himself should receive the title of chief
of the Achæans, and that the citadel of Corinth should be
garrisoned partly by Achæans and partly by Spartan troops.
To this Aratus answered that he was not able to direct
events, but rather was directed by them. As this language
proved that he had no intention of negotiating seriously,
Kleomenes at once invaded the territory of Sikyon, ravaged
the country, and encamped for three months before the walls
of the city. Aratus remained quiet within the walls, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">520</a></span>but
began to consider whether it would be necessary for him to
obtain the assistance of Antigonus by surrendering the
citadel of Corinth to him: for his help was not to be had
on any other terms.</p>
<p>XLII.<a id="p42"></a> The Achæans now assembled at Ægium and invited
Aratus thither. The journey was a dangerous one
for him to make, at a time when Kleomenes was encamped
outside the city of Sikyon; and his fellow-countrymen
endeavoured to keep him back by entreaties and even by
threatening that, when the enemy was so close, they
would not permit him to leave the city; while the women
and children hung upon him weeping, as though he were
the common father and preserver of them all. However,
after addressing a few words of encouragement to them he
rode away towards the sea, accompanied by ten of his
friends and by his son, who was now grown up. At the
beach they embarked on board of some vessels which were
riding at anchor, and proceeded by sea to the assembly at
Ægium, at which it was decreed that Antigonus should be
invited to aid them, and that the citadel of Corinth should
be handed over to him. Aratus even sent his son to
Antigonus among the other hostages. The Corinthians,
disgusted with these proceedings, now confiscated his
property, and presented his house to Kleomenes.</p>
<p>XLIII.<a id="p43"></a> Antigonus now approached with his army, which
was composed of twenty thousand Macedonian foot soldiers,
with thirteen hundred cavalry. Aratus, with the chief
officers of the Achæan league, proceeded by sea to Pegæ to
meet him, thus avoiding the enemy, although he had no
great confidence in Antigonus, and distrusted the
Macedonians. He felt that he owed his own greatness to
the injuries which he had done them, and that his first
rise as a politician was due to his hatred of the old Antigonus.
Yet, driven by inexorable necessity, and by the
exigencies of the times, to which men in authority are
really slaves, he took this desperate course.</p>
<p>Antigonus, as soon as he learned that Aratus was approaching,
met him, and welcomed his companions in a
friendly manner, but showed him especial honour at their
first meeting, and as he found upon trial that Aratus was
a worthy and sensible man, he contracted closer <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">521</a></span>relations
with him than those of mere business. Indeed, Aratus
was not only useful to Antigonus for the management of
great political negotiations, but when the king was at
leisure, proved a more agreeable companion to him than
any one else. Antigonus, young as he was, perceived that
Aratus was not spoiled by royal favour, and soon preferred
him not only above all other Achæans, but even beyond
his own Macedonian courtiers. Thus was the sign which
the god had given him in the sacrifice brought to pass:
for it is said that a short time before this, Aratus was
offering sacrifice and that there appeared in the liver of
the victim two gall bladders enclosed in one caul. The
soothsayer explained this to portend that Aratus would
shortly form an intimate friendship with his greatest
enemy. At the time he disregarded this saying, for he
was always more inclined to follow the dictates of common
sense than to be guided by prophecies and portents.
Afterwards, however, as the war proceeded successfully,
Antigonus made a great feast at Corinth to which he
invited many guests. Among these was Aratus, whom
he placed next to himself. Presently he sent for a
wrapper, and asked Aratus if he also did not feel chilly.
Aratus answered that he was very cold, and Antigonus
then bade him come closer to himself, so that the servants
who brought the wrapper enveloped them both in it.
Then Aratus, remembering the portent, burst out laughing,
and told the king about the sacrifice and the prophecy.
This, however, happened after the times of which I am
writing.</p>
<p>XLIV.<a id="p44"></a> At Pegæ Aratus and Antigonus each plighted
their faith to the other, and then at once marched against
the enemy. Before Corinth several battles took place, for
Kleomenes was securely entrenched there, and the
Corinthians vigorously assisted him. But now one
Aristoteles of Argos, a friend of Aratus, sent secretly to him
to say that he could cause that city to revolt from
Kleomenes, if Aratus would appear before it with some
Macedonian soldiers. Aratus laid the matter before
Antigonus, and hurriedly crossed over to Epidaurus by
sea with a force of fifteen hundred men. The Argives
rose in revolt before his arrival, attacked the troops <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">522</a></span>of
Kleomenes, and drove them to take refuge in the citadel;
and Kleomenes, hearing of this, and fearing that if the
enemy made themselves masters of Argos they might cut
off his retreat, abandoned Corinth and marched by night
to help the garrison of Argos. He arrived there before
Aratus, and won a partial success, but soon afterwards,
as Aratus was marching to attack him, and King Antigonus
was coming on behind Aratus, he retired to
Mantinea. Upon this all the cities of Peloponnesus again
joined the Achæans, and Antigonus received the citadel
of Corinth. The people of Argos now elected Aratus
their commander-in-chief, and he persuaded them to make
a present to Antigonus of all the property of their late
despots and of all traitors. Aristomachus was put to the
torture at Cenchreae and then drowned in the sea, a
proceeding which brought great discredit upon Aratus
for having allowed a man of considerable merit, with
whom he had formerly been intimately connected, and
whom he had persuaded to abdicate his throne and bring
over Argos to the league, to be put to death in this cruel
and illegal manner.</p>
<p>XLV.<a id="p45"></a> By this time also many other charges were
brought against Aratus by the other cities, as, for instance,
that the league had given Corinth to Antigonus just
as if it were some obscure village, and that it had
permitted him to sack Orchomenus and place in it a
Macedonian garrison; that it had passed a decree, that no
letter or embassy should be sent to any other king if
Antigonus did not approve of it; that they were
forced to maintain and pay the Macedonians, and that
they celebrated religious services, processions, and games
in honour of Antigonus, in which the fellow-citizens of
Aratus took the lead, and invited him into their city
where he was the guest of Aratus. All blamed Aratus for
this, not considering that he had given over the reins to
Antigonus, and was now compelled to follow his lead,
having no longer anything except his tongue which he
could call his own, and not daring to use even that with
entire freedom. It was clear that much of what was being
done distressed Aratus, as for instance the affair of the
statues; for Antigonus restored the statues of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">523</a></span>despots
at Argos which had been thrown down, and threw down
all the statues of the captors of the citadel of Corinth,
except only that of Aratus himself: and that, too, although
Aratus begged him earnestly to spare those of the others.
At Mantinea, too, the behaviour of the Achæans was
repugnant to Hellenic patriotism, for having by the help
of Antigonus captured that city, they put to death all
the leading men, and of the rest they sold some and sent
others to Macedonia loaded with fetters, while they made
slaves of the women and children. Of the proceeds of the
sale they divided one-third among themselves, and gave
two-thirds to the Macedonians. Yet this can be justified
by the law of revenge; for though it is a shocking thing
to deal so cruelly with men of one’s own nation, through
anger, still, in great political crises, revenge is sweet and
not bitter, and in the words of Simonides, soothes and
relieves the angry spirit. But what happened afterwards
cannot be thought honourable to Aratus, nor can it be
attributed to political exigencies: for when the city was
presented by Antigonus to the Achæans, and they
decided upon colonising it, Aratus being chosen as its
founder, and being at the time general of the Achæans,
decreed that it should no longer be called Mantinea, but
Antigoneia, which remains its name to this day. Thus,
by his means, the lovely Mantinea, as Homer calls it,<a id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_596_596">596</a>
was wiped out of the map of Greece, and there remains
in its stead a city whose name recalls its destroyer and
the murderer of its citizens.</p>
<p>XLVI.<a id="p46"></a> Subsequently to this, Kleomenes was defeated in
a great battle at Sellasia, left Sparta and sailed to Egypt.
Antigonus, after showing every kindness to Aratus, returned
to Macedonia, where, as he already was suffering
from the illness which caused his death, he sent the heir
to his kingdom, Philip, who was now a mere lad, into
Peloponnesus, advising him to pay the greatest attentions
to Aratus, and through him to negotiate with the cities,
and make the acquaintance of the Achæans. Aratus
welcomed Philip, and so treated him that he returned to
Macedonia full of good will towards himself, and full of
generous feelings and impulses towards the Greeks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">524</a></span></p>
<p>XLVII.<a id="p47"></a> When Antigonus died, the Ætolians, who
regarded the Achæans with contempt because of their
cowardice (for indeed they had become accustomed to be
protected by others, and trusting, entirely to the Macedonian
arms, had fallen into a condition of complete indolence
and want of discipline), began to interfere in the
politics of the Peloponnesus. During their invasion they
incidentally plundered the territory of Patræ and Dyme,
and then marched into the country of Messenia and began
to lay it waste. Aratus, distressed at this, and seeing
that Timoxenus, the general of the Achæans, was acting
slowly and without spirit because his year of office had
almost expired, anticipated his own election as general
by five days, in order to assist the Messenians. He
assembled an Achæan army: but the men were without
military training and were destitute of warlike spirit.
This army was defeated in a battle near Kaphyæ, and
Aratus, who was reproached with having been too rash a
general, now fell into the opposite extreme, and showed
such apathy as often to refuse to seize opportunities for
attack which were offered by the Ætolians, and to permit
them to riot through Peloponnesus with every kind of
wanton insult. Now, a second time, the Achæans stretched
forth their hands towards Macedonia and brought Philip
to interfere in the affairs of Greece. They were the more
willing to take this step because they knew the regard
which Philip felt for Aratus, and the trust which he
placed in him, and they hoped that they should find him
gentle and manageable in all respects.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<a id="p48"></a> At first the king, influenced by the slanders of
Apelles, Megaleas, and some other of his courtiers against
Aratus encouraged those of the opposite faction, and
eagerly pressed for the election of Eperatus as general of
the league. However, as he was utterly despised by the
Achæans, and as nothing useful could be effected while
Aratus was out of office, Philip perceived that he had
made a complete mistake. He now came entirely over to
the side of Aratus, and acted entirely at his dictation.
As he was now gaining both renown and power, he
attached himself more and more to Aratus, imagining
that it was by his means that he gained his successes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">525</a></span>
Indeed it began to be thought that Aratus was able to
school kings as well as he could free cities; for the impress
of his character was to be traced in every one of Philip’s
acts. Thus the lenity with which the young prince treated
the Lacedæmonians after they had offended him, his personal
interviews with the Cretans, by means of which he
gained possession of the whole island in a few days, and
his brilliantly successful campaign against the Ætolians, all
gained for Aratus the credit of giving good advice, and
for Philip that of knowing how to follow it. All this
made Philip’s courtiers more and more jealous of Aratus.
As they could effect nothing against him by secret intrigues,
they proceeded to open abuse, and assailed him at wine-parties
with the most scurrilous impertinence, and once
when he was retiring to his tent after dinner they even
sent a shower of stones after him. Philip was very indignant
at these proceedings, and at once imposed upon
them a fine of twenty talents. Afterwards, as they were
embroiling and troubling his affairs by their intrigues,
he had them all put to death.</p>
<p>XLIX.<a id="p49"></a> Now that Philip was borne along upon the full
tide of success, he developed many vehement lusts, and the
natural wickedness of his nature broke through all the
artificial restraints by which it had been hitherto held in
check, and gradually revealed him in his true colours.
His first act was to seduce the wife of the younger Aratus.
This intrigue he carried on for a long time unsuspected,
as he lived in their house and was treated as an honoured
guest. Next, he began to treat the Greeks in a much
harsher fashion, and evidently intended to rid himself
of Aratus. His conduct at Messene first gave rise to this
suspicion. The Messenians revolted, and Aratus marched
to attack them, but Philip reached Messene one day before
him, and when he entered the city stirred up the passions
of the citizens by asking the aristocracy of the Messenians
in private whether they had no laws to keep down the populace,
and then again in private inquiring of the leaders
of the people whether they had no hands wherewith to
quell despots. After this the chief men took heart and
fell upon the popular leaders, but they, with the assistance
of the people, killed all the magistrates and nearly
two hundred of the other leading citizens.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526">526</a></span></p>
<p>L.<a id="p50"></a> After Philip had thus wickedly exasperated the
Messenians against one another, Aratus arrived. He made
no secret of his distress at what had happened, and did
not restrain his son when he bitterly reproached and
abused Philip. The young man was thought to have
been Philip’s lover; and he now told Philip that after
such deeds he did not any longer think him handsome, but
hideous. Philip made no answer, although he was thought
likely to do so, as he often had burst into a fury when
thus spoken to, but, just as though he had patiently
endured the reproof and was really of a moderate and
statesmanlike disposition, he took the elder Aratus by the
hand, led him out of the theatre, and proceeded with him
as far as the summit of Ithome, to sacrifice to Zeus and to
view the place, which is naturally as strong as the
citadel of Corinth, and if garrisoned would become a
thorn in the side of the neighbouring states, and quite
impregnable. After mounting the hill and offering
sacrifice, when the soothsayer brought him the entrails of
the ox, he, taking them into his own hands, kept showing
them first to Aratus and then to Demetrius of
Pharos, alternately placing them before each, and asking
what they thought was the meaning of the entrails, that
he would keep possession of the citadel, or that he would
restore it to the Messenians. At this Demetrius laughed
and said, “If you have the soul of a soothsayer, you will
give up the place; but if you have that of a king, you will
clutch the ox by both horns,” alluding to Peloponnesus,
which, if he held the citadels of Messene and of Corinth,
would be quite tame and at his mercy.</p>
<p>Aratus remained silent for a long while, but when Philip
begged him to say what he thought, he answered, “My
king, there are many high mountains in Crete, and there
are many strong positions in Bœotia and Phokis. I believe
too, that there are many places of surprising strength in
Acarnania, both on the sea coast and inland, yet you
have not taken any of these, and nevertheless the people
of those countries willingly execute your commands.
Brigands cling to high cliffs and haunt precipitous places,
but kings find nothing so secure as loyalty and goodwill.
This it is that opened to you the Cretan sea, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">527</a></span>the
Peloponnesus. By these arts you, young as you are, have
made yourself the master of the one, and the leader of the
other.” While Aratus was yet speaking Philip gave back
the entrails to the soothsayer, and, taking Aratus by the
hand, said, “Come now, let us go back again,” having been,
as it were, overruled by him into letting the city remain free.</p>
<p>LI.<a id="p51"></a> Aratus now began to withdraw himself from the
court, and by degrees to break off his intimacy with Philip.
When Philip conveyed his army across the Corinthian
gulf into Epirus,<a id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_597_597">597</a> and desired Aratus to make the
campaign with him, Aratus refused and remained at home,
fearing that he might share the disgrace of Philip’s
operations. Philip, after his fleet had been ignominiously
destroyed by the Romans, and his whole enterprise had
failed,<a id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_598_598">598</a> returned to Peloponnesus, and, as he did not
succeed in a second attempt to outwit the Messenians
and to gain possession of their citadel, he threw off the
mask and openly wronged them by ravaging their
territory. Aratus now became quite estranged from him,
and was misrepresented to him. He had by this time
learned the domestic dishonour which he had sustained
from Philip, and grieved over it, though he kept it secret
from his son; for when he had discovered it, he was powerless
to avenge it. Indeed Philip’s character seems to have
undergone a very great and remarkable change, as from a
mild ruler and a modest youth he grew into a profligate man
and an atrocious tyrant. This change was not due to any
alteration of his real nature, but to the fact that he could
now with impunity indulge the vices which fear had
hitherto forced him to conceal.</p>
<p>LII.<a id="p52"></a> His treatment of Aratus showed that he had
always regarded him with a mixture of respect and fear;
for though he desired to make away with him, and considered
that during Aratus’s lifetime he should not even
be a free man, much less a despot or king, yet he would
not openly attack him, but bade Taurion, one of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">528</a></span>generals and friends, to do this secretly, by poison if possible,
during his own absence. This man gained the confidence
of Aratus, and administered drugs to him, whose
action was not quick and sudden, but which produced
slight heats in the body and a chronic cough, and so
gradually undermined his strength. He did not, however,
do this without being discovered by Aratus; but he,
as he could gain nothing by convicting him, continued
to endure his malady just as if it were some ordinary
disorder. Only once when he spat blood, and one of his
friends who was in the same room noticed it and expressed
his concern, Aratus said, “This, Kephalon, is the return I
get for my friendship for the king.”</p>
<p>LIII.<a id="p53"></a> Thus died Aratus at Aegium, when holding the
office of general of the league for the seventeenth time.
The Achaeans wished his funeral to take place in that
city, and to raise a suitable monument over so great a
man; but the people of Sikyon regarded it as a national
misfortune that he should not be buried in their city, and
prevailed upon the Achaeans to deliver up the body to
them. As there was a law which was regarded with
superstitious reverence, forbidding any one to be interred
within the walls of Sikyon, they sent ambassadors to Delphi
to consult the oracle. The Pythia returned the following
answer:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Dost thou, fair Sikyon, hesitate to raise</div>
<div class="line">A fitting tomb to thy lost hero’s praise?</div>
<div class="line">Curst be the land, nay, curst the air or wave</div>
<div class="line">That grudges room for thy Aratus’ grave.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>When this response was brought back all the Achaeans
were delighted, and the Sikyonians in particular, turning
their mourning into joy, put on white robes, crowned
themselves with garlands, and removed the body of Aratus
from Aegium to Sikyon in festal procession with songs
and dances. They chose a conspicuous spot, and interred
him in it with as much reverence as though he were the
founder and saviour of their city. The place is called the
Arateum to the present day, and on the day upon which
he freed the city from its despot, which is the fifth day of
the month Daisius, or Anthesterion in the Athenian
calendar, a sacrifice, called the thanksgiving for safety, is
offered, and also on the day of the month on which <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529">529</a></span>Aratus
was born. The former sacrifice used to be conducted by
the priest of Zeus the Saviour, and the latter by the priest
of Aratus, who wore a headband, not all white, but mixed
with purple. Songs used to be chanted to the music of the
harp by the actors, called the servants of Dionysius, and
the president of the gymnasiums took part in the procession,
leading the boys and young men, after whom, followed the
council of the city, crowned with flowers, and any of the
citizens who wished to do so. Some traces of these proceedings
still survive, as religious ceremonies; but the most
part of the honours paid to Aratus have died out through
lapse of time and change of circumstances.</p>
<p>LIV.<a id="p54"></a> This is the account which history gives us of the
life and character of the elder Aratus. As for his son,
Philip, who was naturally a villain, and whose disposition
combined insolence with cruelty, administered drugs to
him, which were not deadly, but which deprived him of
his reason; so that he conceived a passion for monstrous
lusts and shameful debaucheries, by which he was soon so
worn out that, although he was in the flower of his age,
death appeared to him to be a release from sufferings rather
than a misfortune. Yet Zeus, the patron of hospitality and
of friendship, exacted a notable penalty from Philip for
his wickedness, and pursued him throughout his life: for
he was utterly defeated by the Romans, and forced to surrender
at discretion to them. He lost all his empire, was
obliged to deliver up all his fleet, except five ships, had to
pay a thousand talents and give up his own son as a
hostage, and then only was allowed, by the pity of his
conquerors to keep Macedonia itself and its dependencies.
As he always put to death all the leading men of his
kingdom, and all his nearest relations, he inspired the
whole country with terror and hatred. Amidst all his
miseries he had one piece of good fortune, in having a son
of remarkable promise, and him he put to death out of
jealousy and envy at the honours which were paid him by
the Romans. He left his kingdom to his other son Perseus,
who was said not to be legitimate, but to be the son of a
sempstress named Gnathæna. Over him Paulus Æmilius
triumphed, and so put an end to the dynasty of Antigonus.
However, the family of Aratus survived in Sikyon and
Pellene down to my own times.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">530</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF GALBA.</h2>
<p>I.<a id="q1"></a> The Athenian general Iphikrates thought that a mercenary
soldier ought to be fond both of money and pleasure,
as in that case he would risk his life the more freely to
obtain the means of procuring enjoyment. Most persons,
however, are of opinion that an army, like a healthy body,
should receive no impulses save from its head. Thus we
are told that Paulus Æmilius, when he assumed the command
of the army in Macedonia, and found that the soldiers
did nothing but talk and meddle, as though each man were
a general, gave them orders to keep their hands ready and
their swords sharp, and leave the rest to him. And Plato
likewise, seeing that a good general is useless without a
disciplined and united army, thought that soldiers should
be mild and gentle, as well as spirited and energetic,
because those who know how to obey require a noble
nature and a philosophic training as much as those who
know how to command. The events which took place at
Rome after Nero’s death prove most conclusively that
nothing is more terrible than a military force which is
guided only by its own blind and ignorant impulses.
Demades, when he saw the disorderly and senseless movements
of the Macedonian army after the death of Alexander,
compared it to the Cyclops after he had been
blinded; but the state of the Roman Empire resembled
the fabled rebellion of the Titans, as it was torn asunder
into several portions, which afterwards fought with one
another, not so much because of the ambition of those who
were proclaimed emperors, as through the avarice and
licentiousness of the soldiers, who made use of one emperor
to drive out another, just as one nail drives out another.
When Alexander of Pheræ was assassinated, after <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">531</a></span>reigning
in Thessaly for ten months, Dionysius, sneering at the
shortness of his reign, called him a mere tragedy king;
but the palace of the Cæsars in a shorter time than this
saw four emperors, for the soldiers brought one in and
drove another out, as if they were actors on a stage. The
only consolation which the unhappy Romans enjoyed was
that the authors of their miseries required no avenger to
destroy them, for they fell by one another’s hands, and
first of all, and most justly, perished the man who had
seduced the army into expecting such great things from a
change of Cæsars, and who brought dishonour upon a
glorious action, the dethronement of Nero, by bribing men
to do it as though it were a treason.</p>
<p>II.<a id="q2"></a> Nymphidius Sabinus, who, as has been related, was
together with Tigellinus, Præfect of the Prætorian Guard,<a id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_599_599">599</a>
when Nero’s cause was quite hopeless, and he was evidently
preparing to escape to Egypt, persuaded the soldiers
to salute Galba as emperor, as though Nero were already
gone. He promised to each of the prætorians, or household
troops, seven thousand five hundred drachmas, and to each
of the legionary soldiers serving in the provinces twelve
hundred and fifty drachmæ; a sum which it would have
been impossible to collect without inflicting ten thousand-fold
more misery on mankind than Nero himself had done.</p>
<p>This offer at once caused the downfall of Nero, and soon
afterwards that of Galba; for the soldiery deserted Nero
in hopes of receiving the money, and murdered Galba
because they did not receive it. After this they sought so
eagerly for some one who would give them as much, that
before they obtained the hoped-for bribe, their own treasons
and rebellions proved their ruin. To relate each event
exactly as it happened belongs more properly to the professed
historian; yet, those words and deeds of the Cæsars
which are worthy of record ought not to be passed over
even by an essayist like myself.</p>
<p>III.<a id="q3"></a> It is generally agreed that Servius Sulpicius Galba
was the richest private person who ever was raised to the
throne of the Cæsars. Though illustrious by birth, being
descended from the noble family of the Servii, he prided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">532</a></span>himself even more upon his relationship with Catulus,<a id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_600_600">600</a>
who, though he shrank from taking any active part in
politics, was yet one of the most virtuous and eminent
men of the time. Galba was likewise related to Livia,
the wife of Augustus, and by her influence he had been
raised from the post which he held in the palace to the
office of consul. He is said to have ably commanded the
army in Germany, and to have gained especial praise by
his conduct as proconsul in Libya. But when he became
emperor, his simple and inexpensive mode of life was
thought to be sheer meanness, while his ideas of discipline
and sobriety appeared obsolete and ridiculous. Nero,
before he had learned to fear the most eminent of the
Romans, had appointed Galba to a command in Spain.
Indeed, besides the mildness of his character, it was
thought that his advanced age was a guarantee against
his engaging in any rash enterprise.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="q4"></a> While Galba was in Spain, the procurators of the
emperor treated the provincials with the greatest harshness
and cruelty. Galba could not afford them any assistance,
but he made no secret of his sympathy with them
and sorrow at their wrongs, and thus afforded them some
relief while they were being condemned unjustly and sold
into slavery. Many scurrilous songs also were written
about Nero and sung and circulated everywhere, and as
Galba did not discourage this, and did not share the indignation
of the procurators, he became even more endeared
to the natives, with whom he was already intimately
acquainted, as he was now in the eighth year of his command,
during which Junius Vindex, who commanded the
army in Gaul, revolted.</p>
<p>It is said that before Vindex committed any overt act
of rebellion he wrote to Galba, and that Galba neither
agreed to his proposals nor yet denounced him, as some
other generals did; for many of them sent Vindex’s letters
to Nero, and as far as they were able ruined his cause.
Yet these men afterwards became traitors, and so proved
that they could betray themselves as well as Vindex.
When, however, Vindex openly raised the standard of
revolt, and called upon Galba to accept the offer of empire,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">533</a></span>
and constitute himself the head of a strong body—namely,
the troops in Gaul, a hundred thousand armed
men, and many times more men capable of bearing arms—Galba
called a council of his friends. Some of them advised
him to temporise, and watch the progress of events at
Rome; but Titus Vinius, the captain of the prætorian
cohort, said, “Galba, why do you hesitate? for you
cannot remain quiet, and yet think of remaining faithful
to Nero. If Nero is to be your foe, you must not refuse
the proffered alliance of Vindex, or else you must at
once denounce him and attack him, because he wishes
the Romans to have you for their chief rather than Nero
for their tyrant.”</p>
<p>V.<a id="q5"></a> After this, Galba by an edict appointed a day upon
which he would grant manumission to whoever might wish
it, and rumour and gossip drew together on that day a great
multitude of people eager for revolution. No sooner did
Galba appear upon the tribune than all with one voice
saluted him as emperor. Galba did not at once accept this
title, but spoke in disparagement of Nero, deplored the
best citizens of Rome who had been murdered by him, and
promised that he would watch over his country to the
best of his power, not as Cæsar or Emperor, but merely as
the general of the Senate and people of Rome. That
Vindex acted justly and on due reflection when he offered
the empire to Galba, is proved by the conduct of Nero
himself; for though he affected to despise Vindex and to
regard Gaul as of no importance, yet as soon as he heard
of Galba’s rising, which was when he was at breakfast
after his bath, he overturned the table. However, as the
Senate declared Galba a public enemy, Nero, wishing to
show his courage and to jest with his friends, said that this
gave him a good pretext for raising the money of which
he stood in need; for when he had conquered the Gauls
he would sell their spoils by public auction, and in the
meantime he could at once confiscate the estate of Galba,
as he had been declared a public enemy. Nero, after
this, ordered Galba’s property to be sold, and Galba, when
he heard of this, ordered all Nero’s property in Spain to be
put up to auction and found people much more ready to
purchase it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">534</a></span></p>
<p>VI.<a id="q6"></a> Many now revolted from Nero, and all these, as
might be expected, declared for Galba, with the exception
of Clodius Macer, in Africa, and Virginius Rufus<a id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_601_601">601</a> who
commanded the German army in Gaul, who each acted for
themselves, though for different reasons. Clodius, who
had plundered his province, and put many men to death
from cruelty and covetousness, hesitated, because he could
neither continue to hold his command nor yet give it
up with safety. Virginius on the other hand, who was at
the head of the most powerful force in the empire, and
who was constantly saluted as emperor by his soldiers
and urged to assume the purple, declared that he would
neither become emperor himself nor yet allow any one else to
do so without the consent of the Senate. Galba was at first
much disturbed at this. Soon the two armies of Vindex
and Virginius, like horses that have taken the bit between
their teeth, fought a severe battle with one another.
After two thousand Gauls had fallen, Vindex committed
suicide; and a rumour became prevalent that after so
signal a victory the whole army would either place
Virginius upon the throne, or would return to their
allegiance to Nero. Galba, who was now greatly alarmed,
wrote to Virginius, begging him to act in concert with
him, and preserve the empire and liberty of the Romans.
Meanwhile he retired with his friends to Colonia, a city
of Spain, where he occupied himself more in repenting
of the steps which he had taken, and in regretting the loss
of his usual life of ease and leisure more than in doing
anything to further his cause.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="q7"></a> Summer was just beginning, when one evening,
shortly before dark, there arrived Icelus, one of Galba’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">535</a></span>freed men, who had travelled from Rome in seven days.
Hearing that Galba was retired to rest, he proceeded at
once to his chamber, forced open the door in spite of the
resistance of the attendants, made his way in and told
him that while Nero was still alive, first the army, and
then the people and Senate had declared Galba emperor:
and that shortly afterwards a report was spread of Nero’s
death. The messenger said that he had not believed this
rumour, and that he had not left Rome before he had seen
the corpse of Nero. This news very greatly raised the
credit of Galba, and a multitude of men, whose confidence
in him had been restored by this message, flocked to his
doors to salute him. Yet the time<a id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_602_602">602</a> in which he received
the news seemed incredibly short. But, two days afterwards
Titus Vinius arrived with several other persons,
who brought a detailed account of the proceedings both
of the prætorians and of the Senate. He was at once
promoted to a post of honour; while Icelus was presented
with a gold<a id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_603_603">603</a> ring, received the surname of Marcianus, and
took the first place among the freed men of Galba.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="q8"></a> Meanwhile at Rome Nymphidius Sabinus, not
quietly and by degrees, but by one bold stroke, attempted
to get all departments of the state into his own hands. He
pointed out that Galba was an old man who would scarcely
live long enough to be carried to Rome in a litter; and
indeed Galba was in his seventy-third year. The soldiers
in the provinces, he declared, had long been his friends,
and they now depended on him alone because of the
enormous presents which he offered them, which made
them regard him as their benefactor, and Galba as their
debtor. Nymphidius now at once ordered his colleague
Tigellinus to give up his sword, and entertained all men
of consular or prætorian rank at state banquets, although
he still invited them in the name of Galba, while he
suborned many of the praetorian guard to say that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">536</a></span>must petition Galba to appoint Nymphidius as their
præfect for life without any colleague. He was urged to
even more audacious pretensions by the conduct of the
Senate, who added to his fame and power by addressing
him as their benefactor, by assembling daily to pay their
respects to him, and by requiring him to propose and to
ratify every decree: so that in a short time he became an
object not only of jealousy but of terror to his supporters.
When the consuls chose public messengers to carry the
decrees of the Senate to the emperor, and had given them
the sealed documents known as diplomas,<a id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_604_604">604</a> at the sight of
which the local authorities in all towns assist the bearer
on his journey by relays of horses at each stage. Nymphidius
was much vexed at their not having come to him
to affix the seals and to provide messengers from the
prætorian guard, and he is even said to have thought of
wreaking his displeasure on the consuls; but when they
begged his pardon he forgave them. In order to win the
favour of the people he permitted them to massacre any of
Nero’s creatures who fell into their hands: and they
killed Spicillus the gladiator by throwing him under the
statues of Nero when they were being dragged about the
Forum; laid Aponius, one of the informers, on the ground
and drove waggons loaded with stones over his body, and
tore to pieces many other persons, some of whom were
perfectly innocent, so that Mauriscus, who was justly held
to be one of the noblest men in Rome, openly declared in
the Senate that he feared they would soon wish to have
Nero back again.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="q9"></a> Nymphidius, who thus began to draw nearer to
the object of his hopes, did not dislike being called the son
of Caius Cæsar, who was emperor after Tiberius. It seems
that Caius, when a boy, did have an intrigue with the
mother of Nymphidius, who was a good looking woman,
the daughter of a hired sempstress and of one Callisto, a
freed man of the emperor. But it appears that her intrigue
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">537</a></span>with Caius must have taken place after the birth of
Nymphidius, whose father was generally supposed to have
been Martianus the gladiator, for whom Nymphidia
conceived a passion because of his renown as a swordsman;
and this belief was confirmed by the likeness which he
bore to the gladiator. However, though he did not deny
that Nymphidia was his mother, he nevertheless boasted
that the dethronement of Nero was entirely his own work,
and, not satisfied with having gained by it both honours
and riches, and the embraces of Sporus, the favourite of
Nero, whom he had fetched away from the funeral pyre
of his late master and now treated as his wife, calling her
Poppæa, he was intriguing to gain the throne for himself.
He employed several of his friends, among whom were
some ladies of rank and senators, to further his interests
in Rome, and sent one Gellianus to Spain to watch the
proceedings of Galba.</p>
<p>X.<a id="q10"></a> After Nero’s death all went well with Galba, though
he still felt uneasy about Virginius Rufus, who had not
declared his intentions, and, who, being at the head of a
great and warlike army, with the glory of having overthrown
Vindex and made himself master of a great part of
the Roman Empire, was not unlikely to listen to the
solicitations of those who wished him to assume the purple,
especially as the whole of Gaul was in an excited condition
and ready to revolt. No name was greater or more glorious
than that of Virginius, who was credited with having
saved Rome both from a cruel tyranny and from a war
with Gaul. He, however, according to his original intention,
referred the choice of an emperor to the Senate;
though when the death of Nero was known the soldiers
renewed their solicitation of Virginius to make himself
emperor, and one of the tribunes who attended him in his
tent drew his sword, and bade Virginius choose between
the steel and the throne. But when Fabius Valens, the
commander of one legion, swore allegiance to Galba, and
dispatches arrived from Rome containing an account of
what the Senate had decreed, Virginius, though not without
difficulty, prevailed upon his soldiers to salute Galba
as emperor; and when Galba sent Hordeonius Flaccus to
supersede him, he received him as his successor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">538</a></span>delivered
up the troops to him, met Galba, who was now on the
march for Rome, and joined him without receiving from
him any token either of favour or resentment. Galba
respected Virginius too much to injure him, and Titus
Vinius and Galba’s other adherents opposed his advancement
out of jealousy, though in truth they only assisted
the good genius of Virginius in withdrawing him from the
wars and troubles in which all the other commanders were
involved, and enabling him to live in peaceful retirement
to a good old age.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="q11"></a> At Narbo, a city of Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_605_605">605</a> Galba was met by
envoys from the Senate, who greeted him and invited him
to show himself as soon as possible to his people who were
eager to behold him. Galba showed the envoys every
kindness and hospitality, but at his entertainments would
only use his own plate and other things, though Nymphidius
had forwarded from Nero’s stores sumptuous services of
everything necessary for great banquets, and the imperial
household servants. By this conduct Galba gained the
reputation of being a magnanimous man, above any ideas
of vulgar ostentation; but Vinius presently told him that
this noble and patriotic simplicity seemed merely an artifice
to gain popularity with the lower classes, and that it was
affectation to behave as though he were not worthy of this
magnificence. By these arguments Vinius prevailed upon
him to use Nero’s riches, and not to shrink from an imperial
extravagance at his banquets. Indeed the old man seemed
as though by degrees he would come to be altogether ruled
by Vinius.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="q12"></a> This Vinius was more passionately fond of money
than any one else of his time, and by no means free from
blame in respect of women. When a young man, serving
on his first campaign under Calvisius Sabinus, he introduced
his general’s wife, a dissolute woman, into the camp
disguised as a soldier, and passed the night with her in
the general’s headquarters, which the Romans call the
“Principia.” For this outrage Caius Cæsar imprisoned
him; but on the death of Caius he was fortunate enough
to obtain his release. Once when dining with the emperor
Claudius he stole a silver cup. When Claudius heard of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">539</a></span>it he asked him to dinner on the following day, but when
he came ordered the attendants to serve him entirely from
earthenware, not from silver. Cæsar by this comic punishment
showed that he regarded him as more worthy of
ridicule than of serious anger; but when he had obtained
complete control over Galba, and was the most powerful
man in the empire, his passion for money led him into acts
which partly caused and partly led others to bring about
the most tragic scenes of sorrow.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="q13"></a> Nymphidius, as soon as Gellianus, whom he had
sent as a spy upon Galba, was returned, learned from him
that Cornelius Laco was appointed præfect of the palace
and of the prætorian guard, but that all real power was in
the hands of Vinius.<a id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_606_606">606</a> Gellianus also said that he had had
no opportunity of meeting Galba, and of conversing
privately with him. At this news Nymphidius was much
alarmed. He assembled the officers of the prætorians,
and addressed them, saying that Galba himself was a
kind and moderate old man, but that he never acted
according to his own judgment and was entirely led astray
by Vinius and Laco. “Before these men, therefore,” he continued,
“insensibly obtain for themselves the position
and influence which was formerly enjoyed by Tigellinus,
it is our duty to send an embassy from the prætorian
guard to our chief, to inform him that he will be more
acceptable to us and more popular if he removes these two
of his friends from his court.” As this language was not
approved, for indeed it seemed a strange and unheard of
proceeding, to lecture an old general upon the choice of
his friends, as though he were a young boy just appointed
to his first command, Nymphidius tried another course, and
attempted to intimidate Galba by writing letters to him,
in which he at one time declared that Rome was in an
excited and disaffected condition, and at another that
Clodius Macer had laid an embargo on the corn-ships in
African ports, and that the German legions were rising
in revolt, and that he heard much the same news about
the troops in Syria and Judæa. As Galba did not pay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">540</a></span>much attention to his letters or attach much credit to the
assertions which they contained, he resolved to make his
attempt before Galba’s arrival, though Clodius Celsus of
Antioch, who was a sensible man and a faithful friend,
dissuaded him, saying that he did not believe that there
was one single family in Rome that would address
Nymphidius as Cæsar. Many, however, scoffed at Galba,
and Mithridates of Pontus<a id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_607_607">607</a> in particular, sneering at his
bald head and wrinkled face, said that the Romans thought
a great deal of Galba, now that he was absent, but that
when he came they would think him a disgrace to the age
that called him Cæsar.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="q14"></a> It was now determined that Nymphidius should
be conducted to the camp of the prætorians at midnight
and there proclaimed emperor. Towards evening Antonius
Honoratus, the first military tribune, assembled
the soldiers under his command and addressed them,
beginning by blaming himself and them for having in a
short time so often changed their allegiance, which they
had done, not according to any fixed plan, or in order to
choose the best masters, but as though they were driven
to commit one treason after another by some infatuation
sent by the gods. Their desertion of Nero was indeed
justified by his crimes; but they could not accuse Galba of
having murdered his mother or his wife; nor could they
allege that he had ever disgraced the purple by appearing
on the stage. “Yet,” he continued, “it was not any of
these things that made us desert Nero, but Nymphidius
persuaded us into doing so when Nero had already deserted
us and fled to Egypt. Shall we then kill Galba as well
as Nero? Shall we choose the son of Nymphidia for our
emperor, and slay the son of Livia as we slew the son of
Agrippina? Or shall we rather punish this fellow for his
crimes, and thus prove ourselves the avengers of Nero, and
the faithful guards of Galba?”</p>
<p>This speech of the tribune was agreed to by all his
soldiers, who proceeded to their comrades, and urged them
to remain faithful to Galba, and most of them promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">541</a></span>do so. Soon a shout was raised, either because, according
to some writers, Nymphidius believed that the soldiers
were already calling for him, or else because he wished to
be beforehand with them and fix them while they were
wavering and uncertain whom they should follow.
Nymphidius came forward in the glare of many torches,
carrying in his hand a speech written by Cingonius
Varro, which he had learned by heart and intended to
address to the soldiers. When, however, he saw that the
gates of the camp were closed, and that the walls were
covered with armed men, he was alarmed, and, coming
up to the gates, asked what they wanted, and by whose
orders they were under arms. They all answered with one
voice that they looked upon Galba as their emperor. At
this Nymphidius went up to them, applauded their resolution,
and bade his followers do likewise. The soldiers
at the gate let him pass in, with a few others. Presently
a spear was hurled at him, which Septimius caught
before him on his shield; but as many now attacked Nymphidius
with drawn swords, he ran away, was pursued
into a soldier’s room, and slain there. The corpse was
dragged into a public place where a railing was put round
it, and it was left exposed to public view the next day.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="q15"></a> When Galba heard how Nymphidius had perished,
he ordered such of his accomplices as had not voluntarily
made away with themselves to be put to death: among
whom were Cingonius Varro who wrote the speech, and
Mithridates of Pontus. In this Galba was thought to
have shown himself harsh beyond all usage, if not beyond
all law, and this execution of men of rank without a trial<a id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_608_608">608</a>
was a most unpopular message. Indeed, all men had
expected a very different kind of rule, for they had been
deceived, as is usually the case, by the reports spread at
the beginning of Galba’s reign. They were still further
grieved at the fate of Petronius Turpilianus, a man of
consular rank and a faithful servant of Nero, whom Galba
ordered to destroy himself. In Africa Macer had, it is
true, been put to death by Trebonianus, and Fonteius in
Germany by Fabius Valens, acting under Galba’s orders:
yet in both these cases he had the excuse that he feared,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">542</a></span>them, as they were in open rebellion against him; but
there could be no reason for refusing a trial to Turpilianus,
an old and helpless man, if the emperor had any intention
of carrying out in his acts the moderation of which he
spoke in his proclamations. For all this, therefore, Galba
was blamed by the Romans. When on his journey he
arrived within five-and-twenty stadia (about three English
miles) of the city, he met a disorderly mob of sailors<a id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_609_609">609</a> who
occupied the entire road. These were the men whom
Nero had formed into a legion and treated as soldiers.
They now wished to have their appointment confirmed,
and pushed forward towards the emperor noisily demanding
standards for their legion and quarters to encamp in,
crowding round him in such disorder that he could neither
be seen nor heard by those citizens who had come out to
meet him on his arrival. When he endeavoured to put
the matter off, and said that he would give them an
answer at another time, they, taking his delay to mean a
refusal of their demand, became indignant, and followed
him with loud shouts. As some of them drew their
swords, Galba ordered his cavalry to charge them. No
resistance was offered, but some were cut down in the act
of turning to flee, and some while they ran. It was
thought to be a very bad omen that Galba should make
his entry into the city in the midst of so much blood and
slaughter; but all who had before jeered at him as a
feeble old man now looked upon him with fear and horror.</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="q16"></a> In the giving of presents Galba wished to show
a marked change from the profuse liberality of Nero: but
he seems to have missed his mark, as for example, when
Canus, the celebrated flute-player, performed before him
at dinner, Galba praised his playing and ordered his purse
to be brought. From this he took several gold pieces and
gave them to Canus, telling him that the money came
from his own pocket, not from the revenues of the state.
He also demanded the restitution of the largesses, which
Nero had bestowed on his favourite actors and athletes,
leaving them only a tenth part. As he could scarcely get
any part of the money back from them, for the major part
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">543</a></span>being reckless profligates who lived only for the day’s
enjoyment, had spent it all, he began to search out those
who had bought anything or received any presents from
them, and obliged them to refund. This investigation
caused infinite trouble, for it affected so many persons; it
covered Galba with disgrace and made Vinius loathed and
detested for making the emperor show himself so mean
and pettifogging towards his subjects, while he himself
used his power recklessly, confiscating and selling every
one’s property. Hesiod, indeed, bids us drink deep of—</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“The end and the beginning of the cask;”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>and Vinius, seeing that Galba was old and feeble took his
fill of his fortune, as though it were both beginning and
ending.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="q17"></a> The old emperor received much wrong, first from
the bad arrangements made by Vinius, and also because
Vinius blamed or defeated his best intentions. An instance
of this was his punishment of Nero’s favourites. He did,
indeed, put to death many wretches, among whom were
Helius, Polykleitus, Petinus, and Patrobius. The people
applauded, and cried out as these men were being led
through the Forum, that the sight was a fair one and
pleasing to the gods, but that both gods and men demanded
the punishment of Tigellinus, Nero’s tutor and
instructor in wickedness. That worthy, however, had
previously attached Vinius to himself by a most important
pledge.<a id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_610_610">610</a> So, they argued, Turpilianus perished though
he had committed no crime except that he remained faithful
and did not betray a bad master; while the man, who
first made Nero unfit to live, and then deserted and
betrayed him, was still alive, an evident example that
anything could be obtained from Vinius by those who
could pay for it. The Roman people, who would have
enjoyed no spectacle so much as that of Tigellinus dragged
away to execution, and who never ceased to demand his
head when they assembled in the theatre or the circus,
were astonished at a proclamation in which the emperor,
after declaring that Tigellinus was suffering from a wasting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">544</a></span>
disease and could not live long, begged his people
not to urge him to disgrace his reign by acts of tyranny
and ferocity. In ridicule of the public exasperation
Tigellinus offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods
for the recovery of his health, and prepared a splendid
banquet; while Vinius left the table of the emperor after
dinner and led his widowed daughter to the house of
Tigellinus in a riotous procession. Tigellinus made
her a present of five-and-twenty thousand drachmas, and
bade his chief concubine take off the necklace which she
wore, which, was said to be worth fifteen thousand drachmas,
and put it round his daughter’s neck.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="q18"></a> After these outrages Galba received no credit
even when he acted mildly, as for instance, when he
granted a remission of tribute and the Roman franchise to
the Gauls who had risen in rebellion under Vindex, for it
was believed that they had not received these privileges
from the kindness of the emperor, but had bought them
from Vinius. Thus the people began to dislike the
emperor most cordially, but the prætorian guard, who had
not received their looked-for donative, still cherished a
hope that Galba would give them at least as much money
as they had been wont to receive from Nero, if not as much
as they had been promised by Nymphidius. When Galba
heard of their discontent, he made that remark, so worthy
of a great commander, that “he was wont to enlist his
soldiers, not to buy them,” and this caused the soldiers to
hate him bitterly, for they thought that, besides depriving
them of what was their due, he was trying to regulate
the conduct of future emperors towards them. Yet
disaffection at Rome had not hitherto assumed any distinct
form, for the awe inspired by the presence of Galba
acted as a kind of check upon revolutionary schemes, and
men concealed the dislike with which they regarded him
because they did not see any distinct opportunity of
effecting a change in the government. But the troops in
Germany who had served under Virginius, and who were
now commanded by Flaccus,<a id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_611_611">611</a> were elated with pride at
the victory which they had won over Vindex, and as they
were given nothing, became quite unmanageable by their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">545</a></span>officers. They paid no attention whatever to Flaccus,
who, indeed, besides being quite helpless from his violent
attacks of gout, was entirely without military experience.
Once when the army was assembled at a public spectacle,
and the tribunes and officers offered prayers, as is usual
among the Romans, for the prosperity of the emperor
Galba, the soldiers broke into loud murmurs of dissent,
and then, as their chiefs continued the prayers, shouted
as a response, “If he be worthy.”</p>
<p>XIX.<a id="q19"></a> Very similar reports to these reached Galba concerning
the conduct of the legions under the command of
Tigellinus.<a id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_612_612">612</a> The emperor, fearing that it was not only
his age, but his want of children which brought him into
contempt, now determined to adopt some noble youth as
his son, and make him heir to the throne. There was one
Marcus Otho, a man of illustrious family, and steeped
from childhood in luxury and pleasure beyond most
Romans of his time. As Homer calls Alexander the
“spouse of fair-haired Helen,” celebrating him for the
beauty of his wife, in default of any noble qualities of his
own, so Otho was notorious at Rome in consequence of
his marriage with Poppæa, with whom Nero fell in love
when she was the wife of Crispinus, and, as he had still
some feelings of respect for his own wife, and feared his
mother, made use of Otho to obtain her for him. Otho’s
extravagance made him a friend and companion of Nero,
who was amused at being reproached by Otho for meanness
and parsimony. It is said that once Nero scented
himself with a very costly perfume, and sprinkled a
little of it over Otho. On the next day Otho entertained
Nero, when suddenly a number of gold and silver pipes
squirted out the same perfume over them both as abundantly
as if it were water. Otho seduced Poppæa for
Nero, and prevailed upon her by holding out hopes of an
intrigue with Nero to divorce her husband and marry him.
After she became his wife, he did not like to share her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">546</a></span>favours, but showed great jealousy, at which it is said
Poppæa was not offended, for she used sometimes to
exclude Nero even when Otho was absent, either because
she feared to surfeit him with her society, or according
to some writers, because she did not wish to marry the
emperor, though she was willing enough to have him for
her lover. Otho ran a great risk of losing his life; and
it is strange that Nero, who put to death his own wife and
sister for Poppæa’s sake, should have spared Otho.</p>
<p>XX.<a id="q20"></a> But Seneca was Otho’s friend, and he persuaded
Nero to appoint Otho to the command of the province of
Further Lusitania. Otho gained the love and respect of
his subjects, although he well knew that his appointment
was merely intended as an honourable exile. When
Galba revolted, Otho was the first to join him, brought all
his silver and gold plate for Galba to coin into money, and
presented him with slaves who knew how to wait upon
an emperor. In everything he proved his fidelity to
Galba, while he showed a rare capacity for business, and
on the march to Rome he travelled for days together in
the same chariot with Galba. During this journey, while
he was so familiar with the emperor, he paid special court
to Vinius, both by conversing with him and by giving
him presents, and he firmly established his right to the
second place in the emperor’s favour by always yielding
the first to Vinius. He was more successful than
Vinius in avoiding unpopularity, for he assisted all
petitioners to obtain their demands without taking bribes
from them, and showed himself easy of access and affable
to all. He took special interest in the common soldiers,
and obtained promotion for many of them, sometimes by
applying directly to the emperor, at others by means of
Vinius, or of the freedmen, Icelus and Asiaticus,<a id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_613_613">613</a> who
were the most powerful personages of the court. Whenever
Otho entertained Galba, he always presented each
soldier of the guard in attendance on the emperor with a
gold piece, and thus corrupted the army and won their
affections for himself while he appeared to be doing
honour to Galba.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">547</a></span></p>
<p>XXI.<a id="q21"></a> Now, when Galba was deliberating about the
choice of a successor, Vinius suggested Otho to him.
Vinius did not do Otho even this service gratis, but
because he hoped to have him for a son-in-law, for they
had made a compact that Vinius’s daughter should marry
Otho if he were adopted by Galba and declared his
successor on the throne. But Galba always preferred the
good of the state to his own private advantage, and always
looked, not to what was most pleasant for himself, but
to what was best for Rome. It seems probable that he
would never have chosen Otho even to be heir to his own
estate, for he knew well his licentiousness and extravagance
and his debts, which amounted to fifty millions.<a id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_614_614">614</a>
Wherefore Galba, after having graciously and in silence
listened to Vinius, postponed his decision: only he
appointed himself consul, and Vinius his colleague, and it
was supposed that he would name his successor at
the beginning of the new year. The soldiers eagerly
hoped that this successor would be Otho.</p>
<p>XXII.<a id="q22"></a> While Galba was deliberating and hesitating,
the German army broke out into open rebellion. All the
soldiers alike hated Galba for not having given them
their promised donative, and the troops in Germany
regarded it as a special insult to themselves, that Virginius
Rufus had been so discourteously deprived of his
command, that those Gauls who had fought against them
under Vindex had been rewarded, while those who had
not joined him were punished, and that Galba should
show such gratitude to Vindex and pay him such honour
after his death, as though it was Vindex who had made
him emperor of the Romans. This kind of language was
being openly held in the camp when on the first day of
the new year,<a id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_615_615">615</a> which the Romans call the Calends of
January, Flaccus assembled the army to renew the
customary oath of fidelity to the emperor. The soldiers
overthrew and tore down the images of Galba, swore
fealty to the Senate and people of Rome, and then
dispersed. After this outbreak the officers began to fear
anarchy among the soldiers as much as rebellion: and one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">548</a></span>of them spoke as follows: “What will become of us,
fellow-soldiers, if we neither remain faithful to our
present emperor nor yet create another, as though we had
not merely thrown off our allegiance to Galba, but refused
to obey any master whatever? As for Hordeonius Flaccus
we must pass him over, for he is merely a feeble shadow of
Galba; but within one day’s march of us there is Vitellius,
the chief of the army of Lower Germany, whose father
was censor and thrice consul, and who can point to the
poverty for which some reproach him as a shining proof
of honesty and greatness of soul. Come, let us choose this
man, and show that we know better than the Iberians
or Lusitanians how to elect an emperor.” While some
approved, and some rejected this advice, a standard-bearer
stole quietly away and brought the news of it to Vitellius,
who was entertaining a large company at supper. Soon
the matter became noised abroad throughout the army,
and on the following day Fabius Valens, who commanded
one legion,<a id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_616_616">616</a> rode over to Vitellius’s quarters<a id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_617_617">617</a> with a number
of horsemen and saluted him emperor. It is said that on the
previous days he had refused the purple, and had shrunk
from the burden of empire, but that now, excited by food
and wine which he had taken at midday, he came forward
and willingly heard himself addressed as Germanicus,
though he declined the title of Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_618_618">618</a> The troops under
Flaccus now at once forgot their patriotic oaths of fidelity
to the Senate, and swore to obey the emperor Vitellius.</p>
<p>XXIII.<a id="q23"></a> Thus was Vitellius proclaimed emperor in
Germany. Galba, when he heard of the rising there, no
longer postponed the choice of his successor. He knew
that some of his friends desired the election of Otho, and
some that of Dolabella; but as he himself approved of
neither candidate, he suddenly without any warning
sent for Piso, the son of Crassus and Scribonia, who perished
under Nero, a young man remarkable for his virtues, and
especially for the modesty and austerity of his life. Galba
now at once took this youth to the camp of the prætorian
guard to declare him Cæsar and heir to the empire, though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">549</a></span>as he left the palace he was at once met by evil omens,
and when he began to address the soldiers and to read
aloud a prepared speech it thundered and lightened so
often, and such rain and darkness overshadowed the camp
and the city, that it was impossible to doubt that Heaven
did not approve of the adoption of Piso, and that no good
would come of it. The soldiers were sulky and scowling,
as not even on this occasion was any largesse given to
them. Piso himself was admired by all who saw him,
for as far as they could judge from his voice and manner
he was not bewildered by his good fortune, although he
was not insensible of it, while Otho’s countenance bore
manifest tokens of the bitterness of his disappointment, as
he thought that Galba’s refusal to appoint him after having
chosen him and all but raised him to the throne was
a clear proof of the emperor’s dislike and hatred for him.
Otho was not without fears for the future, and went away
full of hatred for Piso, blaming Galba, and angry with
Vinius. The prophets and Chaldæans whom he kept about
his person would not permit him to give up his hopes, and
especially one Ptolemæus,<a id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_619_619">619</a> who laid great stress upon a
prophecy which he had often repeated to him, that Nero
would not kill him, but would perish before him, and that
he should rule over the Romans; for having proved the one
part of his prophecy to be true, this man bade him not
despair of the other part also coming to pass, while he
was much encouraged by those who came to offer their
sympathy, and treated him as an ill-used man: for many
of the partizans of Nymphidius and Tigellinus, who had
once been in positions of honour, and now had been dismissed
and were in poverty, attached themselves to him
and urged him to revolt.</p>
<p>XXIV.<a id="q24"></a> Among these were Veturius and Barbius, one
of whom was an adjutant, and the other an orderly of the
corps of guides<a id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_620_620">620</a> as the Romans call the scouts and
messengers of their armies. Together with them a freedman
of Otho’s, named Onomastus, went about from man to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">550</a></span>man, and by bribes and promises induced them to stand
by Otho, which they were willing enough to do, as they
were thoroughly disloyal to Galba and only wanted an
excuse to desert him. Indeed, a loyal army could not have
been corrupted in four days, which was all the interval
that elapsed between the adoption of Piso by Galba, and
the murder of them both: for they perished on the sixth<a id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_621_621">621</a>
day after, which the Romans call the sixteenth before the
Calends of February. Early in the morning of that day
Galba was offering sacrifice in the palace, accompanied by
many of his friends. The aruspex, Umbricius, as soon as
he took the entrails of the victim into his hands and looked
at them, said distinctly that they portended great disturbances,
and danger to the emperor from a plot at headquarters.
Thus was Otho all but delivered up to justice
by the hand of God: for he stood close behind Galba and
heard what Umbricius said as he pointed to the entrails.
He was much alarmed, and turned all manner of colours
through fear, when his freedman Onomastus came up to
him and said that the architect was waiting for him at his
house. This was the preconcerted signal of the time
when Otho was to meet the soldiers. He, therefore,
explaining that he had just bought an old house, and
wished to point out its defects to those who had sold it,
went away through what is called the house of Tiberius
into the Forum, where stands a gilded column<a id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_622_622">622</a> at which
all the public roads in Italy terminate.</p>
<p>XXV.<a id="q25"></a> Here they say that he was met and saluted as
emperor by the first of the conspirators, who were not more
than three and twenty in number. Though the luxury
and effeminacy in which he lived had not affected his
courage, for he was a most daring man, yet now his heart
failed him. The others, however, would not let him draw
back, but drew their swords and, standing round his litter,<a id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_623_623">623</a>
ordered it to proceed, while Otho frequently urged the
bearers to go faster, and often muttered to himself, “I am
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">551</a></span>a lost man;” for several persons had heard what had passed,
and looked on more in wonder than alarm, because of the
small number of the conspirators. While he was being
thus carried through the Forum, about as many more men
joined him, and then others came up by twos and threes.
At length they all faced around, and saluted him as Cæsar,
brandishing their naked swords. The tribune Martialis,
who was on guard at the camp of the prætorians, is said
not to have been in the plot, but to have been terrified and
bewildered at Otho’s sudden appearance, and let him pass
in. When he was once within the camp, no one opposed
him; for those who did not know what was being done
found themselves enclosed in small parties of two or three
together by the conspirators, and being thus cut off from
one another, followed the party of Otho at first through
fear, and soon, when the matter was explained to them, of
their own free will.</p>
<p>News of the rising was brought to Galba at the palace
while the aruspex still held the victim in his hands, so
that even those who generally refused to believe in the
omens drawn from sacrifices were astonished at the evident
interposition of Heaven. As a crowd of all kinds of persons
now ran up from the Forum, Vinius and Laco and a few of
the emperor’s freedmen stood round him with drawn swords
while Piso went forward and addressed the soldiers who
were on guard at the palace, and Marius Celsus, a brave
man, was sent to assure himself of the fidelity of a corps of
Illyrians who were quartered in the Portico of Agrippa.</p>
<p>XXVI.<a id="q26"></a> Galba wished to go forth, but Vinius dissuaded
him, while Celsus and Laco urged him to do so, and abused
Vinius roundly. At this time a persistent rumour arose that
Otho had been murdered in the camp of the prætorians;
and presently one Julius Atticus, one of the chiefs of the
emperor’s guards, came up with his sword drawn, shouting
that he had slain the enemy of Cæsar. Pushing his way
through the bystanders, he showed Galba his sword, which
was covered with blood. Galba looked at him, and said,
“Who ordered you to kill him?” As, however, the man
spoke of his loyalty, and the oath of fealty which he had
sworn, and as the crowd shouted that he had done well,
and clapped their hands, Galba got into his litter with <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">552</a></span>the
intention of sacrificing to Jupiter and showing himself to
his subjects. Just as he entered the Forum, like a change
of wind there came a rumour that Otho was at the head of
the soldiers. And now, while in that vast crowd some
called to Galba to turn back, and some to go on, some bade
him be of good courage and others warned him to beware,
and the litter was frequently shaken and swayed to and
fro as if it were on a stormy sea, there suddenly appeared a
body of horsemen, and then some foot-soldiers, who came
through the basilica of Paulus, and loudly shouted to the
people to take “that citizen” away. The populace took to
their heels, but did not run away in fear, but posted themselves
on the tops of the porticoes and on the highest parts of
the Forum as though they were spectators at a public show.
The civil war was begun by Attilius Vergilio,<a id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_624_624">624</a> who tore
down, the image of Galba which he carried on his staff,
and dashed it upon the ground. Many now hurled their
javelins at the litter; and, missing their aim at Galba
with these, they drew their swords and rushed upon him.
No one remained with him or defended him except one
man, the only one of all that vast multitude whom the
sun beheld that day acting worthily of the Roman Empire.
This was a centurion named Sempronius Densus, who
had never received any especial favour from Galba, but
who, prompted merely by his own honour and fidelity,
stood firm in front of his litter. Raising the vine stick,
which is carried by centurions to correct their men, he
shouted aloud and ordered the men who rushed towards
him to spare the emperor. After this, as they tried to
push past him, he drew his sword and defended the
emperor for a long time, until he was brought to the
ground by a blow under the knee.</p>
<p>XXVII.<a id="q27"></a> Galba’s litter was overset near the place called
the Lake of Curtius. As he fell to the ground, wearing a
corslet,<a id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_625_625">625</a> many ran upon him and stabbed him. He,
offering his throat to them, said “Strike, if this be best
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">553</a></span>for Rome.” He received many cuts in the legs and arms,
but the mortal blow in the throat was given, according to
the most common account, by one Camurius, a soldier of
the fifteenth legion. Some writers say that his murderer’s
name was Terentius, some, Lecanius, and some Fabius
Fabulus, who is said to have cut off his head and carried
it away wrapped in his toga, for being bald, it was difficult
to hold with the hands. Afterwards, as those who were
with him would not allow him to carry it so, but wished
him to display his feat of arms, he stuck it on a spear,
and ran along like a Bacchanal, brandishing aloft the aged
head of one who had been a virtuous emperor, a pontiff,
and a consul, often turning himself about and shaking the
spear, down which the blood still ran. When the head of
Galba was brought to Otho, he said, “This is nothing, my
comrades; show me the head of Piso.” Before long it was
brought to him: for the youth had been wounded and fled,
but had been pursued by one Marcus who slew him near
the temple of Vesta. Vinius also was killed, though he
admitted that he had been a party to the conspiracy
against Galba; for he cried out that “Otho did not mean
him to be killed.” However, both his head and that of
Laco were cut off and taken to Otho, from whom the
bearers demanded a present. As Archilochus says,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Though there be of us a thousand, each of whom his man hath slain,</div>
<div class="line">Yet we find but corpses seven, when we come to search the plain.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>So many who took no part in these murders nevertheless
dipped their hands and their swords in the blood and
showed them to Otho, and sent petitions to him asking for a
reward. A hundred and twenty persons were afterwards
discovered to have done this by the written petitions
which they sent to the emperor, all of whom afterwards
Vitellius caused to be searched for and put to death.
Besides these men, Marius Celsus came to the camp.
Many at once accused him of having incited the soldiers
to help Galba, and the mob clamoured for his execution.
Otho, however, did not wish to kill him; but as he did
not dare to directly oppose the soldiers, he said that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">554</a></span>he
would not put him to death in such a hurry, for there
were several questions which he wished to put to him.
On this pretence he ordered him to be imprisoned, and
entrusted him to his own most faithful followers.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<a id="q28"></a> The Senate was at once called together. Just
as though they had become different men, or worshipped
different gods, the senators took the oath of fealty to
Otho, which Otho himself had just broken: and they
addressed him as Cæsar and Augustus while the headless
corpses, dressed in their consular robes, were still lying
in the Forum. As the murderers had no further use for
the heads, they sold that of Vinius to his daughter for
two thousand five hundred drachmas. Piso’s head was
given to his wife Verania,<a id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_626_626">626</a> at her earnest entreaty; and
that of Galba was given to the slaves of Patrobius<a id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_627_627">627</a> and
Vitellius, who subjected it to every kind of indignity, and
at last threw it into the place which is called the Sessorium,
where they execute those who are put to death by the
emperor’s orders. Galba’s body was removed by Helvidius
Priscus, with the permission of Otho: and during
the night it was buried by one Argius,<a id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_628_628">628</a> the emperor’s
freedman.</p>
<p>XXIX.<a id="q29"></a> This was the fate of Galba, who was second to
few of the Romans in birth or wealth, being almost the
first man of his time in both. He lived through the
reigns of five emperors and obtained a great reputation,
by which more than by any power at his disposal he drove
out Nero: for of the many pretenders of that time some
were declared by all to be unfit to reign, and some of their
own accord withdrew their pretensions; but Galba was
offered the throne and accepted it, so that his mere name
caused the rising of Vindex, which had been regarded as
a mere revolt, to be called a civil war, because an emperor
took part in it. As therefore he considered that he had
not so much sought for the management of the empire as
he had had it pressed upon him, he thought to govern the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">555</a></span>spoiled children of Nymphidius and Tigellinus after the
fashion of Scipio, Fabricius, and Camillus of old.</p>
<p>Though his faculties were somewhat impaired by age
he proved himself in all military matters a thoroughly
capable commander of the old school; but he put himself
entirely into the hands of Vinius and Laco, who, just like
the greedy crew that had surrounded Nero, sold everything
in the state to the highest bidder; so that no one
looked back with regret to his reign, though many were
grieved at his death.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">556</a></span></p>
<h2>LIFE OF OTHO.</h2>
<p><a id="r1"></a>The young emperor<a id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_629_629">629</a> proceeded at daybreak to the Capitol,
and offered sacrifice there. Next, he ordered Marius Celsus
to be brought to him, and having embraced him, spoke
kindly to him, and invited him to forget the charge which
had been made against him rather than to remember his
acquittal. Celsus answered with dignity, yet not without
appreciation of Otho’s kindness, that the crime laid to his
charge, being that of fidelity to Galba, to whom he owed
nothing, ought of itself to bear witness to his character.
By these words both Otho and Celsus were thought to
have done themselves equal honour, and were applauded
by the soldiers. After this, Otho made a mild and gracious
speech to the Senate. He assigned part of the time appointed
for his own consulship to Virginius Rufus, and
left in force all the other appointments to consulships
which had been made by Nero or Galba. He gratified
several persons of advanced age, or eminent in other ways,
by appointing them to offices in the priesthood, and restored
to those senators who had been banished by Nero, and had
returned under Galba, all of their property which had not
been sold. In consequence of this, many of the leading
men in Rome, who had at first shuddered at Otho’s accession,
regarding him as some avenging demon who had
suddenly been placed upon the throne, began to look
much more hopefully upon a reign by which they themselves
profited.</p>
<p>II.<a id="r2"></a> At the same time nothing delighted the common
people and reconciled them to Otho so much as his treatment
of Tigellinus. This wretch had hitherto escaped
notice, for all thoughtful men considered him sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557">557</a></span>punished already by his fear of the punishment which the
people demanded as a debt due to the public, and by the
incurable bodily diseases from which he suffered, while
they regarded the foul debaucheries which he still even
when dying continued to lust after, as a greater misery to
him than death itself. Yet many thought it shame that
he should still see the light of day, of which he had
deprived so many noble spirits. Otho sent a messenger
to the country house near Sinuessa, where Tigellinus
dwelt, and where several ships were always riding at
anchor in case he should wish to flee farther from Rome.
Tigellinus at first offered the messenger a vast bribe to
allow him to escape; and as the man refused to do so, he
gave him the money nevertheless, begged of him to wait
until he had shaved, and then, taking up a razor, cut his
throat.</p>
<p>III.<a id="r3"></a> The emperor, though he gratified the people by
this well-deserved execution, yet bore no malice against
any one else of his personal enemies. To please the people
he at first allowed them to address him at public spectacles
as “Nero”; and he allowed several statues of Nero to be
replaced in public. Claudius Rufus states that the diplomas,<a id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_630_630">630</a>
or imperial despatches, which were sent to Spain
by the hands of public couriers, were inscribed with the
name of Nero as well as with that of Otho. However, as
he perceived that this practice gave offence to the first
and most powerful citizens, he put a stop to it. The
soldiers of the prætorian guard were extremely dissatisfied
with the moderate manner in which Otho began his reign,
and they warned him to be on his guard, and cut off all
disaffected persons, either out of a genuine anxiety for his
safety, or merely as a pretext for causing disturbances and
civil wars. One day Otho sent Crispinus<a id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_631_631">631</a> to Ostia to
bring back the seventeenth manipulus<a id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_632_632">632</a> from thence. As
Crispinus, while it was still dark, began to make preparations
for the journey, and loaded waggons with the men’s
arms, some of the most daring soldiers openly declared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">558</a></span>that he had come with disloyal intentions, that the Senate
meditated a coup d’état, and that the arms were meant to
be used against Otho, not for him. As many took up this
idea and became much excited, some seized on the waggons,
others killed Crispinus and their own two centurions who
tried to oppose them, and all, in confusion, calling upon
one another to come to the rescue of Cæsar, marched to
Rome. Hearing that Otho was entertaining eighty of the
senators at dinner, they rushed to the palace, exclaiming
that now was the time to put to death all the enemies of
Cæsar at one stroke. The city was panic-stricken, expecting
at once to be pillaged by the troops; the palace
was filled with confusion and alarm, and Otho himself
terribly perplexed as to what to do; for while he feared
for the safety of his guests, some of whom had brought
their wives to the banquet, they mistrusted him, and he
saw them watching his every movement in silent terror.
He therefore ordered the prefects of the guard to go and
pacify the soldiers, while at the same time he dismissed
his guests by another door. They were scarcely gone
when the soldiers burst tumultuously into the dining-hall,
asking what had become of the enemies of Cæsar. Otho
now mounted on a couch and addressed them; and by
entreaties, and even by tears, at last prevailed upon them
to retire. On the following day, having presented every
soldier with twelve hundred and fifty drachmas, he entered
the camp, where he praised<a id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_633_633">633</a> their zeal on his behalf, and
begged them to join him in punishing a few whose intrigues
had made both his clemency and their own steady
loyalty to be questioned. As all approved, and bade him
do so, he, after selecting for punishment two men whose
fate no one could regret, left the camp.</p>
<p>IV.<a id="r4"></a> Some of the soldiers believed that Otho’s character
was really changed, and admired him for his conduct; while
others bethought that he was only courting popularity
perforce, because of the war which was impending. It
was indeed reported that Vitellius had already assumed
the imperial title and authority; and couriers were constantly
arriving with the news of some fresh accession to
his forces, though other messengers came who stated that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559">559</a></span>the troops in Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Mœsia had, with
their officers, declared for Otho. Soon also friendly letters
reached him from Mucianus and Vespasianus, the former
of whom was at the head of a great army in Syria, and the
latter in Judæa. Encouraged by these, Otho wrote to
Vitellius, bidding him act like a loyal soldier, and promising
that he would bestow on him a great sum of money
and a city in which he might dwell in the utmost peace
and happiness. Vitellius replied at first with dissimulation,
but soon they became irritated, and overwhelmed
one another with abuse, which each well deserved, though
it was ridiculous for either of them to reproach the other
with vices which were common to them both.<a id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_634_634">634</a> Indeed
it was hard to say which of them was the more profligate
or the more effeminate, which had the least experience of
war, or which had been plunged the more deeply in debt
by his former poverty.</p>
<p>At this time many prodigies<a id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_635_635">635</a> and omens were reported,
many of which were vague and could not be traced to any
trustworthy source, though all men saw the reins fall
from the hands of the figure of Victory in the capitol,
who is represented driving a chariot, as though she were
no longer able to hold them; and the statue of Caius<a id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_636_636">636</a>
Cæsar, which stands upon the island in the Tiber, without
any wind or earthquake, was turned round, so as to face
east instead of west. This is said to have taken place
about the time when Vespasianus openly pretended to the
throne. Many also regarded the flooding of the Tiber as
an evil omen; for though it was the season of the year at
which rivers usually are full of water, yet it never rose so
high or did so much damage before; for it laid a great
part of the city under water, especially in the corn-market,
and caused great scarcity of provisions for several
days.</p>
<p>V.<a id="r5"></a> About this time news was brought to Rome that
Cæcina and Valens, acting as the lieutenants of Vitellius,
had seized the passes of the Alps. The prætorians also
conceived suspicions of the loyalty of Dolabella,<a id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_637_637">637</a> a man
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560">560</a></span>of patrician family. Whether Otho feared him or some
one else is uncertain: however, he assured him of his
friendship, and sent him to reside at the city of Aquinum.
Otho now selected the officers who were to company him
on his campaign. Amongst these was Lucius, the brother
of Vitellius, whom he neither promoted nor removed
from the rank in the army which he held. He also took
especial care of the mother and wife of Vitellius, that they
might not have any fear for their own safety. He entrusted
the government of Rome to Flavius Sabinus, either because
he wished to show his respect for Nero (for Sabinus had
been appointed to this post by Nero, and had been
deprived of it by Galba), or because by the promotion of
Sabinus he declared his good will and confidence in
Vespasianus. He himself remained at Brixellum, a city
of Italy situated upon the river Padus, and sent on his
forces under the command of Marius Celsus, Suetonius
Paullinus, and of Gallus and Spurinna, who were all generals
of renown, but who, on account of the want of discipline
of their troops, were unable to conduct the campaign,
according to the plans which they had arranged. Indeed
the soldiers of the guard refused to obey any authority
except that of the emperor himself, for he alone, they
declared, had the right to command them. Nor were the
enemy’s troops altogether obedient and well-behaved, but
the same causes rendered them also swaggering and untrustworthy.
Yet they possessed experience of actual
war, and were accustomed to fatigue; whereas Otho’s troops
were weak from their life of unwarlike leisure, for they
spent most of their time in the theatres and at public
shows, or else in their quarters, and affected such a degree
of insolence that they refused to perform the necessary
labours of a campaign, alleging that to do so was beneath
their dignity, not that it was beyond their strength.
Spurinna, when he endeavoured to force them to do their
duty, came within a very little of losing his life. The
soldiers insulted him grossly, and set no bounds to their
language, calling him a traitor to Cæsar and the ruin of
his cause. Some of them actually got drunk and went to
Spurinna’s tent at night to demand money for a journey;
for they said they must go and impeach him before Cæsar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">561</a></span></p>
<p>VI.<a id="r6"></a> However, the cause of Otho, and Spurinna with it,
received some advantage from the abusive language which
these same soldiers met with at Placentia. Here the
Vitellians who were besieging the city ridiculed Otho’s men
whom they saw on the battlements, calling them stay-at-home
soldiers, sword-dancers, and spectators of games,
declaring that they had never seen or tasted of real war,
but were full of pride at having cut off the head of an
unarmed old man, meaning Galba, though they dared not
come out and fight like men. The soldiers were so
furiously exasperated by these reproaches that they eagerly
besought Spurinna to employ them in whatever service he
pleased, assuring him that they would not shrink from
any toils or dangers. When the enemy furiously assaulted
the walls, and brought up many battering engines,<a id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_638_638">638</a>
Spurinna’s men won the victory, drove back their opponents
with great slaughter, and saved from ruin one of
the most famous and prosperous cities of Italy.</p>
<p>The generals of Otho were found both by cities and by
individuals to be much less offensive to deal with than
those of Vitellius. Among the latter was Cæcina, a man
who neither spoke nor dressed like a citizen of Rome, but
was harsh and overbearing, of great stature, wearing the
Gaulish trousers and sleeves, and using signs<a id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_639_639">639</a> even when
addressing Roman magistrates. He was accompanied by
his wife<a id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_640_640">640</a> who rode with him in a showy dress, escorted by
a picked body of cavalry.</p>
<p>The other general, Fabius Valens,<a id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_641_641">641</a> was so avaricious that
neither the plunder which he took from the enemy, nor yet
the thefts, which he committed or the bribes which he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">562</a></span>received from the allied states could satiate him; and he
was even suspected of having been too late for the first
battle of the war because he delayed his march to amass
wealth for himself. Others blame Cæcina, because in his
haste to win a victory before Valens came up, he, besides
other blunders of less consequence, began a battle so
unseasonably and conducted it so remissly that he very
nearly brought the cause of Vitellius to ruin.</p>
<p>VII.<a id="r7"></a> After Cæcina’s repulse at Placentia he proceeded
to Cremona, another large and flourishing city. Meanwhile
Annius Gallus, who was on his way to Placentia to
reinforce Spurinna, hearing while on the march that the
troops at Placentia had been victorious, but that Cremona
was in danger, changed the direction of his march towards
that place, and encamped close to the enemy. Here Cæcina
concealed many foot-soldiers in rough and wooded ground
ordering his cavalry to ride forward and, if they fell in
with the enemy, to retire little by little so as to draw
them into the ambuscade. This plan was betrayed to
Celsus by deserters. Celsus attacked them with the best
of his cavalry, pursued them with caution, taking care to
avoid the ambuscade, and then surrounded the troops in
ambush, and threw them into confusion. He now sent
for his infantry from the camp: and it was thought that
if they had come up promptly after the cavalry, the whole
army of Cæcina might have been destroyed; but as it
was, Paullinus brought them up slowly and too late, and
tarnished his glory as a general by overcaution. The mass
of the soldiers charged him with treason, and tried to
exasperate Otho against him by boasting that they had
won the victory, but that their success was not followed
up owing to the cowardice of their generals. Otho, though
he did not believe their accusations, yet feared to be thought
to disbelieve them. He accordingly sent his brother
Titianus to the army, and with him Julius Proculus<a id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_642_642">642</a>, the
prefect of the prætorians, who virtually had the supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563">563</a></span>command, though Titianus was the nominal chief, while
Celsus and Paullinus were given the titles of counsellors
and friends, but were not allowed the least real power or
authority.</p>
<p>The enemy also showed want of discipline, especially in
the army of Valens. These men, when they heard of the
ambuscade and the defeat to which it had led, were greatly
enraged at not having been there in time to prevent so
great a slaughter of their friends. Valens<a id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_643_643">643</a> was forced
to beg for his life; for the soldiers were preparing to stone
him. He pacified them with difficulty, and led them to
join the forces of Cæcina.</p>
<p>VIII.<a id="r8"></a> When Otho arrived at the camp at Bedriacum,<a id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_644_644">644</a>
which is a village near Cremona, he held a council of war.
Proculus and Titianus were of opinion that, as the troops
were full of confidence and flushed with victory, it would
be best to fight a decisive battle at once, and not blunt
their spirit by delay, which would also bring Vitellius
down upon them from Gaul. On the other hand Paullinus
argued that the enemy had already collected their entire
available force, whereas Otho might expect another army
as large as his present one to join him from Mœsia and
Pannonia, if he would only wait until it suited him to
fight, and not play into the hands of the enemy by engaging
prematurely. The troops, he said, after being so largely
reinforced, would be no less confident than at present,
when they are but few; indeed, they would fight with a
great superiority of numbers. Besides this, delay would
be all in their favour, as they had abundance of supplies,
while the opponents, who were in an enemy’s country,
would soon be reduced to great straits by the want of provisions.
Marius Celsus agreed with the views of Paullinus.
Annius Gallus was not present at the council, having
been disabled by a fall from his horse: but when Otho
wrote a letter to him, asking his opinion, he advised the
emperor not to be hasty, but to await the arrival of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">564</a></span>legions which were already on their way from Mœsia.
However Otho was not convinced by these arguments, but
agreed with those who urged him to fight at once.</p>
<p>IX.<a id="r9"></a> Many other reasons for this decision are given by
various writers, and it is evident that the prætorians, or
body-guard of the emperor, who now for the first time had
experience of actual warfare, were eager to return to their
old haunts at Rome, and the unwarlike pleasures of the
theatre and the circus, and that their eagerness for battle
could not be restrained, as they imagined that they would
overthrow their antagonists at the first onset. It seems,
too, that Otho himself could no longer endure the uncertainty
of his position, for his ignorance of war and his
life of enervating luxury had unfitted him for a calm
calculation of his chances of success, and, worn out as he
was with anxiety, he longed to let the matter be settled
whichever way chance might determine, like a man who
covers his face through dizziness at looking over a precipice.
This is the account which is given by the orator Secundus,
who acted as private secretary to Otho. Other<a id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_645_645">645</a> authorities
relate that many efforts were made by the soldiers of both
armies to combine, and agree to elect an emperor from
among their own officers: or, if this proved impossible, to
place the election in the hands of the senate. It seems
indeed rightly probable, considering the ill-repute of both
claimants of the throne, that the more sedate and thoughtful
of the soldiers should have reflected that it would be a
horrible and shameful thing that the Romans should be
made to suffer for a second time all the miseries which
they had once endured in the civil wars of Sulla and of
Marius and of Cæsar and Pompeius, merely in order to provide
an empire to bear the charges of the gluttony and
drunkenness of Vitellius, or of the luxury and profligacy of
Otho. It is suspected that Marius Celsus, knowing that
this feeling was gaining ground, endeavoured to gain time,
hoping that the whole matter might be decided without
fighting; and that Otho, fearing this, hurried on an
engagement.</p>
<p>X.<a id="r10"></a> After the council Otho again retired to Brixellum.
This was a mistake, not only because the army would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565">565</a></span>have fought with greater zeal and discipline when under
the eye of the emperor, but because by taking away the
best and most loyal troops, both of cavalry and infantry,
to act as his body-guard, he made his army like a spear
which has lost its steel point. At this time a battle took
place on the bank of the Padus, across which Cæcina endeavoured
to throw a bridge, while the Othonians tried
to prevent him from doing so. As they did not succeed
in this, they threw lighted sulphur and pitch into the
boats which formed the bridge, and a wind suddenly
springing up carried the fire across the stream towards the
enemy. At first volumes of smoke, and then a mass of
flames burst out, so that the enemy were thrown into
confusion and forced to leap from the bridge into the
river, upsetting the boats and exposing themselves to the
missiles and the ridicule of the enemy. However, the
Germans were victorious in a fight with Otho’s corps of
gladiators for the possession of an island in the river, and
slew many of them.</p>
<p>XI.<a id="r11"></a> As, after this, the soldiers in Otho’s camp at Bedriacum
were frantically eager for battle, Proculus led
them forward about six miles from that place and encamped
in such an ignorant and ridiculous fashion that the
men suffered from want of water, although it was spring
time, and all the surrounding country was full of springs
and perennial streams. On the next day he wished to
lead them at least twelve miles nearer the enemy, but
Suetonius Paullinus would not allow him to do so, thinking
that the soldiers ought to have some rest, and not
first be fatigued with a long march, and then while they
were confusedly mixed up with baggage animals and
camp-followers, be brought to fight against an enemy who
could quietly and deliberately place themselves in order
of battle. While the generals were at variance, one of
the horsemen called Numidians rode up bearing a letter
from Otho, in which he ordered them not to waste any
time, but to march against the enemy at once. On
receiving this they started. Cæcina, hearing of their
march, was much disquieted, abandoned his operations
by the river, and proceeded to the camp. Here after
Valens had got the men under arms, and had given <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566">566</a></span>them
the watchword, he sent forward the best of the cavalry
while the legions were taking up their respective positions
in the line of battle.</p>
<p>XII.<a id="r12"></a> For some reason or other the men of Otho’s
vanguard conceived an idea that the generals of Vitellius
intended to dessert to their side: and so, when they came
near to one another, they saluted the Vitellians and addressed
them as friends and comrades. As the Vitellians
made an angry and fierce response, the Othonians were
discouraged, while their opponents imagined that they intended
to desert. This incident at the first onset caused
some confusion among the troops of Otho: and, besides
this, everything was in disorder, for the baggage train
was entangled among the ranks, and the line was broken
in many places by the ditches and trenches with which
the ground was intersected, so that the soldiers, in trying
to avoid these obstacles, were forced to attack in detail, and
in disorganised crowds. Two<a id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_646_646">646</a> legions alone, that named
“Rapax” on the side of Vitellius, and “Adjutrix” on
that of Otho, were able to find a level plain, upon which
they deployed into a regular line of battle and fought front
to front for a long time. Otho’s soldiers were active and
brave, but had never been in action before, while those of
Vitellius had fought many battles, but were somewhat
elderly and past their prime. At the first charge the
Othonians drove them back, and captured their eagle,
killing almost every man in the front rank; but the
Vitellians, filled with shame and rage, charged in their
turn, slew Orfidius, the legate in command of the legion,
and took many standards. The corps of gladiators, who
were supposed to possess both courage and practice in close
combat, were attacked by Alphenus Varus with the
Batavians, who inhabit an island formed by the river
Rhine, and who are the best horsemen in Germany.
Few of the gladiators stood to receive their charge, but
most of them fled towards the river, where they fell in
with other bodies of the enemy, by whom they were entirely
cut to pieces. The worst fight of all was made by
the Prætorians, who did not even wait until the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">567</a></span>reached them, but by their panic flight struck terror even
into the unbroken troops through whose ranks they fled.
Yet many of Otho’s troops, after having conquered their
immediate opponents, forced their way back through their
victorious enemies to their own camp.</p>
<p>XIII.<a id="r13"></a> Of the generals, neither Proculus nor Paullinus
dared to return with their men, but went off another way,
fearing the soldiers, who already began to throw the blame
of their defeat upon the generals. Annius Gallus assumed
the command of the soldiers as they assembled in the town
of Bedriacum, and encouraged them by assurances that
the battle had been a drawn one, and that in many cases
they had beaten the enemy. Marius Celsus called a meeting
of the generals, and bade them take measures for the
common good. He said that after so great a disaster and
so much slaughter of their countrymen not even Otho himself,
if he were a right-thinking man, would wish to make
any further trial of fortune; since even Cato and Scipio,
although they fought in defence of the liberty of Rome,
were blamed for having wasted the lives of many brave
men in Africa, by not yielding to Cæsar immediately after
the battle of Pharsalia. All men, he urged, are equally
liable to the caprices of fortune; but they have the advantage,
even when defeated, of being able to form wise resolutions.
By this reasoning Celsus convinced the generals: and
when, on trying the temper of the soldiers, they found them
desirous of peace, and Titianus himself bade them begin
negotiations for agreement, Celsus and Gallus determined
to go and discuss the matter with Cæcina and Valens. On
their way they were met by some centurions, who informed
them that Vitellius’s army was already advancing, and
that they had been sent on before by their generals to
arrange terms of peace. Celsus spoke with approval of
their mission, and bade them return and conduct him to
Cæcina. It happened that when they drew near the army,
Celsus was like to have lost his life: for the cavalry who
formed the advance guard were the same who had been defeated
in the ambuscade, and when they saw Celsus approaching,
they set up a shout of rage and rode towards him.
However the centurions stood before Celsus and kept them
back; and as the other officers called to them to spare <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568">568</a></span>him
Cæcina perceived that some disturbance was taking place
and rode up. He quickly repressed the disorderly movement
of the cavalry, greeted Celsus affectionately, and
proceeded with him to Bedriacum. Meanwhile Titianus
had repented of having sent the embassy. He manned the
walls of the camp with those soldiers who had recovered
their spirits, and was encouraging the rest to fight. However,
when Cæcina rode up and held out his hand no one
resisted him, but some of the soldiers greeted his troops
from the walls, and others opened the gates, came out and
mingled with the new-comers. No violence was done to
any one, but they all fraternised and shook each other
by the hand, swore fealty to Vitellius and joined his
army.</p>
<p>XIV.<a id="r14"></a> The above is the account which most eye-witnesses
give of the battle, though they themselves admit that they
do not know all the details of it because of the confusion
which prevailed and the irregularity of the ground. Some
time afterwards when I was journeying across the battlefield,
Mestrius Florus, a man of consular rank, who had
fought under Otho not from choice but from necessity,
showed me an ancient temple, and related that after the
battle he came there and saw so huge a pile of corpses, that
those on the top were level with the pinnacles of the roof.
He said that he could not discover himself or learn from
any one else the cause of this heap; for though a greater
slaughter of the vanquished is made in civil wars than in
any others, because no quarter is given, as no use can be
made of prisoners, yet it was hard to imagine how
such a mass of carcasses came to be piled together on
that spot.</p>
<p>XV.<a id="r15"></a> Otho, as is usual in such cases, first heard only
confused rumours of how the battle went. When however
wounded men came from the scene of action bringing
the news of the defeat, not only his friends, as might be
expected, bade him keep up his spirits and not despair,
but his soldiers were wonderfully affected. None of them
left him, or deserted to the enemy, and no one consulted
his own safety when his chief despaired of his. All of
them alike repaired to his quarters, and called him their
emperor. When he came out to them, they fell at his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569">569</a></span>feet
and caught hold of his hands with shouts, and prayers,
and tears, beseeching him not to desert them, or betray
them to the enemy, but to make use of them to fight for
him, body and soul, until their last breath. While all
besought him thus, one of the common soldiers drew his
sword, and crying, “Cæsar, this is what we are all
prepared to do for you,” stabbed himself. Otho, unmoved
by any of these entreaties, gazed round upon them all
with a calm and composed countenance, and said: “My
comrades, your noble conduct and your loyal devotion
make this a happier day to me than that on which you
elected, me your emperor. Yet do not deprive me of the
still greater happiness of dying for so many and such
noble friends. If I am worthy to be an emperor of Rome,
I ought not to grudge my life to my country. I am aware
that our enemy’s victory is not decisive or crushing.
News has reached me that the Mœsian legions have
already reached the Adriatic, and are not many days’
march distant. Asia, Syria, Egypt, and the army engaged
with the Jews are all on our side, while we have in
our power both the senate, and the wives and children
of our enemy. But we are not defending Italy from
Hannibal, or Pyrrhus, or the Cimbri, but Romans are
fighting against Romans, and our native land will suffer
equally whichever side is victorious, for she must lose
what the conqueror gains. Believe me, I pray you,
that it is more to my honour to die than to reign: for I
cannot imagine that if victorious I could do anything
which would benefit the Romans so much as I can by
giving my life to obtain peace and concord, and to save
Italy from seeing another day such as this.”</p>
<p>XVI.<a id="r16"></a> After speaking thus, he tore himself away from
the soldiers, who tried to hold him back and bade him
take courage. He ordered his friends and such senators
as were present to leave his camp: and to those who were
not present he sent similar orders, and also rescripts to
the magistrates of the cities through which they would
have to pass, that they might accomplish their journey<a id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_647_647">647</a>
with honour and in safety. He next sent for his nephew
Cocceius, who was still a youth, and bade him be of good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570">570</a></span>cheer and not fear Vitellius, whose mother, children, and
wife he himself had protected as carefully as if they had
been members of his own family. He had wished, he said,
to adopt the boy as his heir, but had put off doing so till the
end of the war, meaning to make him his colleague if he
succeeded, but not wishing to involve him in his own
destruction if he failed. “My last charge to you,” he
continued, “is that you neither forget altogether nor yet
remember too well that you have had a Cæsar for your
uncle.” Shortly after this interview Otho heard a
shouting and disturbance outside his quarters; for the
senators were preparing to depart, and the soldiers were
threatening to murder them if they did so, and reproached
them with deserting their emperor. Otho, who feared
for their lives, now came out a second time, no longer in
a mild and supplicatory manner, but, frowning savagely,
he cast so terrible a look upon the most turbulent of the
rioters that they shrank away terrified and abashed.</p>
<p>XVII.<a id="r17"></a> Towards evening he became thirsty, and drank
a little water: after which he spent a long time in examining
the blades of two swords. At last he rejected one
of them, and hid the other in his clothes. He now called
together his servants, and distributed his money amongst
them, not recklessly, as though he were dealing with
property not his own, but giving them each various sums,
carefully apportioned according to each man’s deserts.
When he sent them away he rested for the remainder of
the night, and those about his bed-chamber noticed how
soundly he slept. At daybreak he called to a freedman
who had been entrusted with the management of the departure
of the senators, and ordered him to learn what
had happened to them. When he was told that they had
left the camp, and had received every attention they could
wish, he said, “Go now, and show yourself to the soldiers
unless you wish to perish miserably at their hands; for
they will suspect you of having assisted me to die.”
When this man was gone, Otho held the sword upright
with both his hands and fell upon it, dying with only one
groan, which apprised those without of his fate. The
wailing of his slaves was taken up by the whole of the
camp and city. The soldiers noisily forced their way <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571">571</a></span>into
his quarters and lamented over him with bitter grief, reproaching
themselves for not having guarded their emperor,
and prevented his dying for them. None of Otho’s body-guard
deserted him, although the enemy was drawing
near, but after laying out his body, and erecting a funeral
pile, they bore him to it, armed at all points; and happy
was the man who could find a place among the bearers.
Of the rest, some kissed his wounds, some pressed his hands,
and some, who could not come near him, knelt as his body
passed by them. Some, who had received no especial
favours from Otho, and had nothing to fear from his successor,
slew themselves after they had applied the torch to
his funeral pile. It seems, indeed, that no king or despot
ever was possessed with so frantic a desire to rule, as these
men had to be ruled by Otho and to serve him; for their
love for him did not cease with his life, but remained implanted
in their breasts, causing them to regard Vitellius
with the bitterest hatred. Of what followed from this I
shall give an account in its proper place.</p>
<p>XVIII.<a id="r18"></a> After the remains of Otho were buried they
erected over him a tomb which could offend no one either
by its size or by the pomp of its inscription. When I was
at Brixellum I myself saw a small monument on which
was written in the Latin language “In memory of Marcus
Otho.”</p>
<p>Otho died in his thirty-seventh year, after a reign of three
months. Many good men, though they blamed his life, yet
could not refrain from admiring his death; for though his
life had been no better than that of Nero, his end was a
far nobler one. When he was dead, Pollio, one of the two
prefects, offended the soldiers by requiring them at once
to swear fealty to Vitellius. Some of the senators were
still left in Brixellum; and the soldiers, hearing of this,
let them go with the exception of Virginius Rufus, whom
they greatly embarrassed by coming to his house under
arms, and bidding him either take the command of them or
at any rate act as ambassador on their behalf. Virginius,
who had refused the crown when it was offered him by
a victorious army, thought that it would be the act of a
madman to accept it from a beaten one. He feared, also,
to go as an ambassador to the Germans, who thought <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572">572</a></span>that
in time past he had forced them to do many things against
their will. Accordingly, he escaped from his house by a
back door; and the soldiers, when they discovered that he
was gone, took the oaths to the new emperor. They were
pardoned by him, and were sent to serve with the troops
under the command of Cæcina.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Plutarch calls the Lives of Agis and Kleomenes a History, though
he says in his Life of Alexander (c. 1) that his object is not to write
Histories (ἱστορίαι) but Lives (βίοι). But the Lives of the two Spartan
reforming kings may consistently enough be called a History, when
contrasted with the Lives of the two Roman reforming tribunes.
Plutarch’s notion of History as contrasted with Biography appears
pretty plainly from the first chapter of his Life of Alexander. A
complete view of the events in the Lives of Alexander and Caius
Julius Cæsar would have formed, according to his notion, a History;
but he does not aim at this completeness: he selects out of the events
of their lives such as best show the character of the men, whether the
events be of great political importance or of none at all, and this
method of treating the subject he calls a Life. I believe the word
Biography is a modern invention. The distinction between History
and Annals, though the words have sometimes been used indiscriminately
(c. 3, notes), is clearly expressed by the Roman historian
Sempronius Asellio, as quoted by Aulus Gellius (v. 18).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Most of Plutarch’s extant Lives run in parallels, whence they are
entitled Parallel Lives. He compares a Greek with a Roman: thus
he compares Alexander with Caius Julius Cæsar, and Demosthenes
with Cicero. The beginning of the Life of Tiberius Gracchus is
somewhat abrupt, after Plutarch’s fashion. He had no regular plan
for beginning and ending his stories, and thus he avoids the sameness
which is so wearisome in a Dictionary of Biography. The career of
Tiberius and Caius Gracchus was the same, and accordingly Plutarch
considers their lives as one; and he has found a parallel to them
in two Spartan kings, who were also reformers, Agis IV. and
Kleomenes III.
</p><p>
Agis became king of Sparta <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 244, and reigned only four years:
his colleague in the first part of his reign was Leonidas II., and afterwards
Kleombrotus. Agis attempted to restore the old institutions of
Lykurgus which had fallen into disuse. Wealth had become accumulated
in a few hands. He proposed to adjust the disputes between
debtor and creditor by the short method of abolishing debts; and he
proposed to restore the spirit of the old institutions by dividing all the
lands in equal lots among the Spartan citizens, the chief class in the
state; and by assigning lots also to the Periœki, who were in the
relation of subjects. He carried the project for the abolition of debts,
but before he could accomplish the rest of his reforms, he was thrown
into prison and strangled there. His grandmother and mother, both
of whom had favoured his schemes of reform, were strangled at the
same time. He was about twenty-four years of age when he died.
His reform was not a revolution, but an attempt to restore the old
constitution.

Kleomenes III., King of Sparta, reigned from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 236 to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 220.
In the first part of his reign, the infant son of Agis IV., and afterwards
Archidamus V., the brother of Agis IV., were his colleagues.
Leonidas II., who had been deposed by Agis, had returned to Sparta
during the absence of Agis on a military expedition, and he was most
active in bringing about the death of Agis. Leonidas compelled the
widow of Agis to marry his son Kleomenes, who was instructed by his
wife in the views and designs of Agis. Thus Kleomenes also became
a reformer, and attempted to restore the institutions of Lykurgus.
But his measures were violent. He is charged with poisoning his
infant colleague, the son of the widow whom he married, and with
other wrongful acts. He was defeated at the head of the Spartan
army by Antigonus in the great battle of Sellasia <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 222, and fled to
Egypt, where he was kindly received by Ptolemæus III. (Euergetes)
the king. Ptolemæus IV. (Philopator) the successor of Euergetes, put
Kleomenes in prison, but he contrived to get out and attempted to
make a revolution in Alexandria. Failing in the attempt Kleomenes
killed himself. “In this manner,” says Polybius, “fell Kleomenes; a
prince whose manners were dexterous and insinuating, as his capacity
in the administration of affairs was great: and who, to express his
character in a word, was most admirably formed by nature both for a
general and a king” (Polybius, v. c. 39; Hampton’s Translation, v.
chap. 4). Plutarch in his comparison of Agis and Kleomenes with
Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, concludes that “Tiberius in virtue
surpassed the rest, that the youth Agis was guilty of the fewest faults,
and that in doing and daring Caius was much inferior to Kleomenes;”
which appears to be a correct judgment.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> His complete name was Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. The
Sempronia gens contained the families of the Atratini, Gracchi, and
Pitiones. The Gracchi were plebeians, and the Atratini patricians:
the order of the Pitiones is uncertain. The name of the Gracchi is
best known from the political career of the two brothers, whose
measures were the immediate cause of the civil disturbances which
ended in the establishment of the Imperial power. Tiberius Gracchus,
the father, was tribune of the plebs <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 187, consul <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 177 and a
second time in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 163: he was censor <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 169. Tiberius Gracchus
had his first triumph in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 178 for his victories over the Celtiberians
in Spain while he was proprætor of Hispania Citerior, or that
division of the Peninsula which was nearer to the Pyrenees (Liv. 41,
c. 11). In his first consulship Gracchus had Sardinia assigned for his
province, and he defeated the Sardinians in a great battle. He was
continued in his province as proconsul, and he completely subdued
the island (Liv. 41, c. 21), for which he had a triumph which appears
to be commemorated by an extant medal (Rasche, <i>Lexicon Rei
Numariæ</i>). Cicero numbers Tiberius among the Roman orators
(<i>Brutus</i>, c. 20).</p></div>

at Liternum in Campania. Though Tiberius Gracchus, the

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 187 he prevented Scipio from being tried on certain frivolous
charges brought against him by the tribunes, and owing to this
interference of Gracchus, the greatest commander that Rome had yet

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This story of the snakes is told by Cicero in his treatise on
Divination (i. 18, ii. 29). He says that Tiberius died a few days after
he had let the female snake go, and he refers as his authority to a
letter of Caius Gracchus to M. Pomponius:—“I wonder,” says
Cicero, “if the letting loose the female was to cause the death of
Tiberius, and letting loose the male was to cause the death of
Cornelia, that he let either of them go. For Caius does not say that
the haruspices said any thing of what would happen if neither snake
was let go.” To the objection, that the death of Gracchus did follow
the letting loose of the female snake, Cicero replies that he supposes
he must have died of some sudden attack, and he adds that the
haruspices are not so unlucky but that their predictions sometimes
happen to come true.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> I do not know if this offer of King Ptolemæus is noticed by any
other writer. It is not certain whether it was Ptolemæus VI. Philometor
or his younger brother Ptolemæus VII. Euergetes II. Their
two reigns lasted 64 years from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 181 to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 117. Philometor died
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 146 and was succeeded by Euergetes who died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 117. The
death of Tiberius Gracchus the father is not ascertained. He married
his wife Cornelia after <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 183 and he was consul <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 163. His son
Tiberius, who was killed <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 133, was not thirty years old at the time
and therefore was born about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 163. Caius, who was nine years
younger, was born about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 154. It is not known whether Caius was
the youngest child of Cornelia. Ptolemæus Philometor went to Rome
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 163, being driven out of his kingdom by his younger brother
Euergetes, and he was well received by the senate. His brother also
made a journey to Rome in the following year, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 162. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 154
Ptolemæus Euergetes was at Rome for the second time, and he obtained
the aid of the senate against his brother. Both the brothers may have
seen Cornelia at Rome, but probably during the lifetime of her husband.
Scipio Africanus, the son-in-law of Cornelia, was sent on an embassy
to Alexandria to Euergetes <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 143. An Egyptian king might wish to
strengthen himself at Rome by an alliance with the illustrious families
of the Gracchi and the Scipios; but it is impossible to determine which
of these two kings was the suitor. Philometor is spoken of as a mild
and generous prince: Euergetes, who was also called Physcon, or Big-belly,
was a cruel sensualist. The daughter of Scipio Africanus, the
conqueror of Hannibal, might well decline a marriage with him, and
any Egyptian alliance would have been viewed as a degradation to a
noble Roman matron. The portrait of Physcon is given in Rosellini’s
work on Egypt, from the ancient monuments, and he is very far from
looking like a winning suitor. Kaltwasser assumes that it was Ptolemæus
Philometor who made the offer to Cornelia; and he adds that he
was also called Lathyrus; but this is a mistake; Lathyrus was the
surname of Ptolemæus VIII. Soter II., the son of Physcon. He has not
examined the chronology of these two kings.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This was Publius Cornelius Scipio Æmilianus Africanus Minor.
He was the son of L. Æmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, and
he was the adopted son of P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of the conqueror
of Hannibal. According to the Roman usage in case of adoption, the
son of Æmilius Paulus took the name of his adopted father, P. Cornelius
Scipio, to which was added, according to the usage, the name of
Æmilianus, which marked the gens to which he belonged by birth.
It was after the destruction of Carthage that he acquired the additional
name or title of Africanus, like his adoptive grandfather, from whom
he is usually distinguished by the addition of the name Minor or
younger. The daughter of Cornelia, whom he married, was named
Sempronia. She was ugly and bore her husband no children, and they
did not live harmoniously together. (Appian, <i>Civil Wars</i>, i. 20.) As to
the Roman names see the note on Marius, c. 1.</p></div>

Jupiter and Leda. Pollux was a boxer, and Castor distinguished for
his management of horses and as a runner. Their statues were generally
placed side by side with their appropriate characters, to which
Pluturch alludes.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Plutarch uses the Greek word Bema (βῆμα), which is the name
for the elevated stone station in the Pnyx from which the Athenian
orators addressed the public assemblies. The place from which the
Roman orators addressed the public assemblies was called the Rostra,
or the beaks, because it was ornamented with the beaks of the ships
which the Romans took from the people of Antium. (Liv. 8, c. 14.)
The Rostra were in the Forum, and in a position between the Comitium
and that part of the Forum which was appropriated to the meeting of
the Roman tribes. (See Caius Gracchus, <a href="#d5" class="pginternal">ch. 5.</a>)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The history of this Athenian demagogue is in Thucydides, ii. &amp;c.
The play of Aristophanes called “The Knights” (Ἱππῆς) is directed
against him. By his turbulent oratory he acquired some distinction at
Athens during the Peloponnesian war, after the death of Perikles. (See
Plutarch, <i>Nikias</i>, c. 2, 3.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The MSS. have δελφῖνας, dolphins, which some critics would
change to δελφικάς, tables made at Delphi or in Delphic fashion.
Plinius (<i>Nat. Hist.</i> 33, c. 11) speaks of these dolphins, though he does
not say what they were. The alteration in the text is quite necessary. The
dolphins were probably ornaments attached to some piece of furniture.
Plutarch gives the value in drachmæ, the usual Greek silver coin, and
the money of reckoning: the usual Roman money of reckoning was
the sestertius. Plinius mentions the value of these dolphins at 5000
sestertii a pound, which would make 4 sestertii equivalent to a drachma.
The drachma is reckoned at about 9-3/4<i>d.</i> and the sestertius at 2-1/4<i>d.</i> under
the Republic.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The original is literally “an instrument for practising the voice
by which they raise sounds.” Perhaps a musician may be able to
interpret the passage, without explaining the instrument to be a pitch-pipe
as some have done. Cicero (<i>De Orat.</i> iii. 60) tells the same story
somewhat differently. He says that this Licinius was a lettered man
(literatus homo), and that he used to stand behind Caius Gracchus,
yet so as to be concealed, with an ivory pipe (fistula), when Gracchus
was addressing the public assemblies; his duty was to produce a
suitable note either for the purpose of rousing his master when his tone
was too low or lowering his tone when it was too vehement. (See also
Dion, <i>Fragmenta</i>, p. 39, ed. Reimarus.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> An augur was one who ascertained the will of the gods by certain
signs, but more particularly the flights of birds. The institution of
augurs was coeval with the Roman state, and as the augural ceremonial
was essential to the validity of all elections, the body of augurs
possessed great political influence. The college of augurs at this time
consisted of nine members, who filled up the vacancies that occurred in
their body. A member of the college held his office for life, and the
places were objects of ambition to all the great personages in the state.
They were not appropriated to a class of priests: they were held by
persons who had no other priestly character. Cicero, for instance, was
an augur. The Roman system of placing the highest religious offices
not in the hands of a priestly class, but in the hands of persons who
had held and might still hold civil offices, perhaps possessed some
advantages. There are many valuable remarks on the Roman Auguria
and Auspicia in Rubino, <i>Untersuchungen über Römische Verfassung</i>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Appius Claudius Pulcher was a member of the Claudia gens, and
belonged to an old patrician family, which had long been opposed to
all the pretensions of the plebeian order. He was consul <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 143. He
did not long survive his son-in-law. Cicero (<i>Brutus</i>, 28) enumerates
him among the orators of Rome; he observes that he spoke fluently,
but with rather too much heat.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> The rank of Princeps Senatus was given at one time by the censors
to the oldest of those who had filled the office of censor (Liv. 27, c. 11),
but after the election of Q. Fabius Maximus mentioned in the passage
of Livius, it was given to any person whom the censors thought most fit;
and it was for the same person to be reappointed at each successive lustrum,
that is, every five years. It was now merely an honorary distinction,
though it had once been a substantive office. The title was
retained under the Empire by the Emperors; and Princeps is the title by
which Tacitus designates Augustus and his successor Tiberius. The title
has come down to us through the French language in the form of Prince.
</p><p>
Plutarch sometimes gives the Roman words in a Greek form, but he
more usually translates them as well as he can, which he has done in
this instance. The titles consular, censorian, prætorian, were the
Roman names for designating a man who had been consul, censor, or
prætor.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Livius (38, c. 57) is one of those who tell the story of Scipio
Africanus the elder giving his daughter Cornelia to Tiberius Gracchus
the father. Plutarch has done best in following Polybius, who was
intimate with the younger Africanus and had the best means of knowing
the facts.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> I have retained this name for Africa as it is in Plutarch. The
Greek name for the continent of Africa was Libya (Λιβύη), which the
Romans also used. In the Roman writers Africa properly denotes the
Roman province of Africa, which comprehended Carthage and a considerable
territory; but it was common enough for the Romans to designate
the whole continent by the name of Africa.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Plutarch is here alluding to the campaign of Scipio in which he
destroyed Carthage <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 146, whence he got the name of Africanus. It
was usual for the Roman commanders to have with them a number of
youths of good family who went to learn the art of war, and were
trained under the eye of the general, to whose table and intimacy they
were admitted according to their deserts. Thus Agricola, during his
early service in Britain, was attached to the staff of Suetonius Paullinus.
(Tacitus, <i>Agricola</i>, c. 5.) Those who were admitted to the intimacy
and tent of the commander, were sometimes called Contubernales.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Caius Fannius Strabo was quæstor in the consulship of Cn. Calpurnius
Piso and M. Popilius Lænas <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 139, and two years after he was
prætor. He served in Africa under the younger Scipio Africanus, and
in Spain under Fabius Maximus Servilianus. He was the son-in-law
of Lælius, surnamed Sapiens, or the Prudent. He wrote an historical
work which Cicero sometimes calls a History (<i>Brutus</i>, c. 26), and sometimes
Annals (<i>Brutus</i>, c. 21; <i>De Oratore</i>, ii. 67). It is unknown what
period his work comprised, except that it contained the history of the
Gracchi. Cicero does not speak highly of his style, but Sallustius
seems to commend his veracity (Lib. i. <i>Historiarum</i>).
</p><p>
Tiberius would be entitled to a mural crown (muralis corona), which
was the reward of the soldier who first ascended the enemy’s wall.
Plutarch appears to mean that Fannius also received one. Livius (26,
c. 48) mentions an instance of two mural crowns being given by Scipio
(afterwards Africanus) at the capture of Nova Carthago (Carthagena)
in Spain.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> It appears that at this time the quæstors had their provinces
assigned by lot, and this was the case under the Empire. (Tacitus,
<i>Agricola</i>, c. 6.) The functions of a quæstor were of a civil kind, and
related, in the provinces, to the administration of the public money.
He was a check on the governor under whom he served when he was
an honest man: sometimes the quæstor and governor agreed to wink at
the peculations of each other.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Caius Hostilius Mancinus was consul with Marcus Æmilius Lepidus
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 137. Numantia, which gave the Romans so much trouble, was

site corresponds to it.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The Romans used the words Iberia and Hispania indifferently to
denote the Spanish Peninsula. From the word Hispania the Spaniards
have formed the name España, the French Espagne, and the English
Spain. The river Ebro, which the Romans called Iberus, is a remnant
of this old name. The Iberi originally occupied a part of Southern
Gaul (the modern France) as far east as the Rhone, where they bordered
upon the Ligurians. They were a different people from the Celtæ, who
in the time of C. Julius Cæsar occupied one of the three great divisions
of Gaul. (<i>Gallic War</i>, i. 1.) The Celtæ, at some unknown time,
crossed the Pyrenees and mingling with the Iberi, formed the Celtiberi,
a warlike race with whom the Romans had many wars, and over whom
Tiberius, the father of Tiberius Gracchus, gained a victory. (Note, c.
1.) It is maintained by William Humboldt in his work on the original
inhabitants of Spain (<i>Prüfung der Untersuchungen über die Urbewohner
Hispaniens</i>) that the present Basque is a remnant of the Iberian language,
which he supposes not to have been confined to Spain, but to
have spread over part of Italy, the south of France, and the islands of
Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Thucydides (vi. 2) says that the Sicani,
or old inhabitants of Sicily, were Iberi who were driven from the river
Sicanus in Iberia by the Ligurians.
</p><p>
The name Iberia was also given by the Greeks and Romans to a
part of that mountainous region, commonly called the Caucasus, which
lies between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The Albani and
Iberi were the two chief nations that occupied this tract; the Albani
were between the Caspian Sea and the Iberi, who were their neighbours
on the west. The great river Cyrus (Kur) flowed through
Albania into the Caspian. Iberia was partly surrounded by the mountains
of the Caucasus and it bordered on Armenia and Colchis: the
river Cyrus was the chief river (Strabo, 499, ed. Casaub.). There is no
evidence that these Iberi of the Caucasus were related to the western
Iberi. The country was invaded by the Romans under L. Lucullus
and Pompeius Magnus.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The allusion is to a memorable event in the Samnite war. The
consuls Spurius Postumius Albinus and Titus Veturius Calvinus <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
321, with their army, were caught by the Samnites in the pass called
Furculæ Caudinæ, and they were compelled, in order to save themselves,
to submit to the ignominy of passing under the yoke. The
Roman senate rejected the terms which had been agreed on between
the consuls and the officers of the army on the one side, and the Samnites
on the other. It was not a treaty (fœdus) as Livius shows, for
such a treaty could not be made without the consent of the Populus nor
without the proper religious ceremonies. (Liv. 9, c. 5.) The senate,
upon the proposition of Postumius himself, sent to the Samnites all the
persons who were parties to the agreement and offered to surrender
them, but the Samnites would not receive them and they upbraided
the Romans for want of good faith.
</p><p>
Mancinus also supported the proposition for his own surrender to the
Numantines, and he was offered to them in due form by the officer
called the Pater Patratus, but the Numantines declined accepting him.
(Cicero, <i>De Officiis</i>, iii. 30.) The principle that a general could not
formally make a treaty, and that all treaties required the sanction of
the senate or in earlier times perhaps of the patrician body in their
assembly, appears to be well established. Those who made the treaty
with a Roman general might not know this constitutional rule, but the
principle on which the Romans acted in such cases was sound, and the
censure that has been directed against them as to their conduct in such
transactions, proceeds from ignorance of the Roman constitution and of
the nature of the power which a sovereign state delegates to its ministers.
Delegated power or authority never authorises the persons to
whom it is delegated to do an act which is inconsistent with the constitution
or fundamental principles on which the sovereign power is
based.
</p><p>
Mancinus returned to Rome and ventured to appear in the senate,
but a question was raised as to his right to be there, for it was argued
that a man who had been so surrendered ceased to be a citizen and
could not recover his civic rights by the fiction of postliminium, as a
man who had escaped from the enemy could. (Cicero, <i>De Oratore</i>, 40.)
But the subtlety of the Romans found a solution of the difficulty in the
case of Mancinus: there can be no surrender, if there is nobody to receive
the surrender; therefore Mancinus was not surrendered; therefore
he was capable of recovering his civil rights. (Cicero, <i>Topica</i> 1.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The war of Numantia was prolonged to their disgrace, as the
Romans considered it, and they at last elected Scipio consul B.C. 134,
and sent him to Spain. He took Numantia after a siege of fifteen
months, and totally destroyed it, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 133, the same year in which his
brother-in-law Tiberius Gracchus lost his life. (Velleius Paterc. ii. 4.)
Caius Gracchus, the brother of Tiberius, served under Scipio at Numantia,
and also Jugurtha, afterwards king of the Numidians, and
Caius Marius, the conqueror of Jugurtha.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Plutarch’s account of the Roman public land is brief and not
satisfactory. A clearer statement, which differs from Plutarch’s in
some respects, is given by Appian. (<i>Civil Wars</i>, i. 7, &amp;c.) The
Roman territory (Romanus Ager) was originally confined to a small
circuit, as we see from the history of the early wars of Rome. Even
Aricia (La Riccia) about fifteen miles south-east of Rome, was a city
of the Latin confederation in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus. (Liv.
1, c. 50.) The Romans extended their territory by conquest, and they
thus acquired large tracts of land in Italy, which were made the property
of the state under the name of Ager Publicus. This public land
was enjoyed originally by the patricians, and perhaps by them only, on
payment of a certain rent to the treasury (Ærarium). The rents of
the public land were a large part of the public income, and intended
to defray a portion of the public expenditure. The plebs soon
began to lay claim to a share in these lands, and a division of some tracts
was made among the plebeians in the reign of Servius Tullius. The
lands divided among the plebeians were given to them in ownership.
The tracts of public land which were enjoyed by the patricians on the
terms above mentioned, were considered, as they, in fact, were, public
property; and the interest of the patricians in such lands was called a
possession (possessio). Those who enjoyed the public land as a
possessio were said to possess it (possidere), and they were called
possessores, a term which often occurs in the first six books of Livius,
and which Plutarch has attempted to translate by a Greek word
(κτηματικοί). It is likely enough that the patricians abused their right
to the use of the land by not always paying the rent; as we may
collect from the passages in Dionysius (<i>Antiq. Rom.</i> viii. 70, 73, ix. 51,
x. 36). Their enjoyment of extensive tracts also prevented the public
land from being distributed among the plebeians to the extent that
they wished. The disputes between the two orders in the state, the
aristocracy or nobles and the plebeians, or, as Livius generally calls
them, the patres and the plebs; (the padri and the plebe of Machiavelli,
<i>Discorsi</i>, &amp;c.), about the public land, commenced with the agitation
of Spurius Cassius, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 486, the history of which is given by
Livius in his Second Book (c. 41). The contest was continued at intervals
to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 366, when a law was passed which is commonly called
one of the Licinian Rogations, which forbade any man to have a possession
in the public lands to the amount of more than 500 jugera.
This is the law to which Plutarch alludes.

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> The words in Plutarch literally signify “barbarian prisons,” but I
have used the word ergastula, which was the Roman name, though it
is a word of Greek origin, and signifies “working-places.” The ergastula
were places generally under ground and lighted from above:
they were used both as places to work in and as lodging-places for
slaves who cultivated the fields in chains. (Plinius, <i>N.H.</i> 18, c. 3;
Floras, iii. 19.) They were also places of punishment for refractory
slaves. The object of these places of confinement was also to prevent
slaves from running away, and rising in insurrection. The slaves
were placed at night in separate cells to prevent all communication
between them. When the slaves broke out in rebellion in Sicily under
Eunus, who is mentioned by Plutarch (Sulla, c. 36), the ergastula were
broken open, and a servile army of above sixty thousand men was
raised. The Roman master had full power over his slave, who was
merely viewed as an animal; and these ergastula, being in the country
and out of sight, would give a cruel master full opportunity of exercising
his tyranny. They were abolished by the Emperor Hadrian
(Spartianus, <i>Hadrianus</i>, 18).</p></div>

Tiberius Gracchus. Blossius is mentioned by Cicero (<i>Lælius</i>, c. 11) as

of Tarsus was a Stoic. The two sons of Cornelia had a learned education
and were acquainted with the language and philosophy of the Greeks,
and it is probable that the moral and political speculations with which
they thus became familiar, and their associating with Greeks, had considerable
influence on their political opinions. Tiberius Gracchus the
father was also well enough acquainted with Greek to speak the
language. His oration to the Rhodians was spoken in Greek.</p></div>

Cicero (<i>Brutus</i>, 25). But this Postumius was too old to be a rival of
Gracchus. Another of the same name was consul <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 110, and conducted

too young to be a rival of Gracchus. (Cicero, <i>Brutus</i>, 34.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> This was P. Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, the son of P.
Mucius Scævola, and the adopted son of P. Licinius Crassus Dives, as
appears from Cicero (<i>Academ.</i> 2, c. 5), who mentions him with his
brother P. Scævola as one of the advisers of Tiberius Gracchus in his
legislation. Crassus was consul with L. Valerius Flaccus <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 131.
He was a soldier, a lawyer, and an orator. He lost his life in the war
against Aristonikus in the Roman province of Asia <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 131. It is
remarked that he was the first pontifex maximus who went beyond
the limits of Italy, for he was consul and pontifex maximus when he
went to carry on the war against Aristonikus. (Livius, <i>Epitome</i>, 59.)
The pontifex maximus, as the head of religion, had important duties
which required his presence at Rome.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The illustrious family of the Scævolæ produced many orators and

Tiberius Gracchus attempted his reform. He attained the dignity of
pontifex maximus in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 131 on his brother’s death. Scævola was
probably a timid man. Cicero states that his brother openly favoured
the measures of Tiberius; and Scævola was suspected of doing so.
After the death of Tiberius he approved of the conduct of Scipio
Nasica, who was the active mover in this affair, and assisted in drawing
up several decrees of the Senate in justification of the measure and
even in commendation of it. (Cicero <i>Pro Domo</i>, c. 34; <i>Pro Plancio</i>, 36.)
He was a great orator, but his chief merit was as a jurist. He was the
father of a son still more distinguished as a jurist, Quintus Mucius
Scævola, who also became pontifex maximus, and was one of the
teachers of Cicero. He is considered to be one of those who laid the
foundations of Roman law and formed it into a science (<i>Dig.</i> 1, tit. 2,
s. 2). Quintus Mucius Scævola, commonly called the augur, also a
distinguished jurist, was a cousin of P. Mucius Scævola, the pontifex,
and a teacher of Cicero before Cicero became a hearer of the pontifex.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The eloquence of Tiberius Gracchus is commemorated by Cicero
(<i>Brutus</i>, c. 27), who had read his orations. He describes them as not
sufficiently ornate in expression, but as acute and full of judgment. The
specimens of the orations of Tiberius (c. 9. 15) and those in Appian
(<i>Civil Wars</i>, 9. 15) fully bear out the opinion of Cicero as to his acuteness.
Some German writers assert that these speeches in Plutarch are
either fabricated by him or taken from other writers; but assertions
like these, which are not founded on evidence, are good for nothing.
Plutarch gives the speeches as genuine: at least he believes them to
be so, and therefore he did not fabricate them. And it is not likely
that any body else did. These two fragments (c. 9. 15) bear no resemblance
to the style of most writers who have fabricated speeches.
They are in a genuine Roman style. If any man could fabricate them,
it was Livius, and Plutarch may have taken them from him.</p></div>

better known as Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus and as the Emperor
Augustus, was a descendant of Caius the second son of Cneius. Cicero,
whose opinion about the Gracchi changed with the changed circumstances
of his own life, commends the opposition of Marcus Octavius
to the measures of Gracchus. (<i>Brutus</i>, c. 25.) He also says that
Octavius was a good speaker.
</p><p>
The institution of the tribuni plebis is one of the most important
events in the history of Rome, and the struggle between the plebeians
headed by their tribunes, and the nobility, is the development of the
constitutional history of Rome. Though there were tribunes in the
kingly period, the establishment of the tribuni plebis as the guardians
of the plebs is properly referred to the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 494, when the plebs
seceded to the Mons Sacer or the Sacred Mount. On this occasion the
patricians consented to the election of two tribunes from the plebs.
(Livius, 2, c. 33: compare Livius, 2, 56. 58.) The number was afterwards
increased to ten, and this number continued unaltered. Only a
plebeian could be elected tribune. The persons of the tribunes were
declared to be sacred (sacrosancti). Their powers were originally
limited, as above stated, to the protection of the rights of the plebs
and of the individuals of the plebeian body against the oppression of
the patrician magistrates. It is not possible within the compass of a
note to trace the history of the gradual increase of the tribunitian
power (tribunitia potestas): such a subject is a large chapter in the
history of Rome. Incidental notices often appear in Plutarch’s Lives,
which will help a reader to form a general notion of the nature of the
magistracy, and the effect which it had on the development of the
Roman constitution. The article Tribuni in Smith’s Dictionary of
Greek and Roman Antiquities gives an outline of the functions of the
tribuni plebis.
</p><p>
Very soon after the institution of the tribunate, the nobles learned
the art of destroying the power of the college of tribunes by gaining
over one or more of the members; for, as Plutarch states, the opposition
(intercessio) of a single tribune rendered the rest of his colleagues
powerless.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> As this is the first time that I have used this word, it requires
explanation. The origin of the Roman state is a matter involved in
great obscurity; but its history after the expulsion of the kings <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
509 is the history of a struggle between a class of nobles, an
aristocracy, and the people. The old nobility of Rome were the
patricians, whom Livius calls indifferently patres (father) and patricii.
In his early History patres and plebs are opposed to one another, as
we should now oppose the terms nobles or aristocracy, and commonalty
or people; not that nobles and aristocracy are among us
exactly equivalent, but in the history of Rome there is no distinction
between them. Livius frequently uses the term patres and plebs as
comprehending all the Roman citizens (ii. 33). The word populus
was originally and properly not the people in our sense; it signified
the superior and privileged class and was equivalent to patricians.
The plebs were originally not a part of the populus. In later times
the word populus was often used loosely to express generally the Roman
people, and the style and title of the Roman state was Senatus Populusque
Romanus—The Senate and the Roman populus, which term
populus in the later republic certainly included the plebs, though
the plebs is still spoken of as a class. As the plebeians gradually
obtained access to the higher honours of the state and to the consulship
by a law of Licinius Stolo <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 366, a new class of nobles was
formed out of those persons who had enjoyed those honours and out
of their descendants. This class was called nobiles by the Romans;
the word nobilitas denoted the rank or title of the class, but it was
also used like our word nobility to express the body of nobiles.
Livius uses this term even in the earlier books of his History, but
perhaps not with strict correctness, for in some cases at least he makes
the term nobility equivalent to the patricians. He wrote in the
reign of Augustus, and he has not always applied his terms in the
earlier periods with perfect accuracy. Still we may trace the meaning
of political terms in the Roman writers with great clearness, for no
nation ever stuck more closely to old forms and expressions, and there
is a wonderful precision in the use of political terms by Roman writers
of all ages and of all classes. The name patricians still existed after
the term nobilis was introduced: a noble might be either a patrician
or a plebeian, but the distinction was well understood between an old
patrician family and a plebeian family, however distinguished the
plebeian family might become. Under the Emperors it was not
uncommon for them to promote a man to the rank of patrician for
eminent services, which under the monarchy was equivalent to the
conferring of a title of dignity in modern times, and nothing more.
(Tacit. <i>Ann.</i> xi. 25.)
</p><p>
In Cicero we find the aristocratical order often spoken of as the
optimates (the class of the best), a term which corresponds to the
Greek aristi (ἄριστοι), whence we have the word aristocracy, which,
however, the early Greek writers, at least, only used to express a form of
government and not a class of persons. Cicero on one occasion (<i>Pro
P. Sestio</i>, c. 45) attempts to give to the word optimates a much wider
signification; to make it comprehend all good and honest people: but
this is a mere piece of rhetoric. When a poor plebeian heard the
optimates spoken of, he never imagined that it was intended to place
him among them, were he as honest as the best man among the
optimates. Cicero also says the populares were those who merely
spoke and acted to please the multitude; which shows that populus
must now have changed its meaning: the optimates were those who
wished to act so as to get the approbation of all honest men.
</p><p>
Plutarch’s perception of the early periods of Roman history was
perhaps not strictly exact; but he comprehended very clearly the
state of the parties in the age of the Gracchi. On the one side were
the nobles and the rich, some of whom were noble and some were not;
on the other side were the people, the mass, the poor. The struggle
was now between rich and poor, and the rich often became the
leaders of the poor for the purpose of political distinction and influence,
and hence the name populares. Probably few states have ever
presented the spectacle of the striking contrast between wealth and
poverty which the Roman state exhibited from the time of the Gracchi;
a class of rich, rich by hereditary wealth and by all the modes of
acquiring wealth which the possession of office and the farming of the
public revenues offered to them; a class of poor who were born poor,
who had little industry and few means of exercising it. To this we
must add, that though there were many cultivators in the country who
might enjoy a moderate subsistence from their small estates, there was
a city crowded with poor who had votes, and by their union and
numbers mainly determined the elections and the acceptance or rejection
of legislative measures. Rome, in fact, was the centre of all
political agitation, and the result of a revolution in the city generally
determined the dispute between two rival factions. We have still to
take into the account a very numerous class of slaves. It is probable
that in the earlier periods of Roman history the slaves were comparatively
few; in the later republic they became very numerous.
They formed a large part of the wealth of the rich, and they were
always a dangerous body to the state. The effect of employing slaves
generally in agriculture and other occupations was, as it always must
be, unfavourable to industry among free men. Slaves, also, were often
manumitted, and though the son of a manumitted slave was in all
respects on the same footing as a complete Roman citizen, if his father
was made such by the act of manumission, yet persons of this condition,
and especially those who had been liberated from slavery, were
looked upon as a somewhat inferior class. Their connection with the
powerful families to which they had belonged, also gave such families
great influence in all elections; and as we see in various instances, the
class of libertini, manumitted slaves, was viewed as a dangerous body
in the state. The equites at Rome can scarcely be called a middle
class: they were generally rich and the farmers of the revenues, under
the name of publicani. They were often opposed to the senate, but
it was an opposition of pure interest, and their wealth made them
rather the partisans of the aristocratical than of the popular body.
Such were the political elements with which Tiberius Gracchus had to
deal, when he attempted a reform which perhaps the times did not
render practicable, and for which he certainly did not possess the
courage or the judgment or the inflexible resolution which were
necessary to secure success. The word in Plutarch which I have here
translated nobles is δυνατοί, the powerful. In other places he calls
them the rich (πλούσιοι), the possessors [of public land] (κτηματικοί),
the aristocratical body (ἀριστοκρατικοί); and perhaps other terms. He
calls the plebs, or people as opposed to this class, by various names, of
which δῆμος is the most common: he also calls them the multitude
(πλῆθος), the many (πολλοί), and other like names.
</p><p>
It is impossible to attain perfect precision in the use of political terms
in a translation of Plutarch; and in order to be critically exact, it would
be necessary to load these notes continually with remarks. But this
critical exactness is not required here: the opposition of the two orders
in the state is intelligible to everybody. The contests in Rome from
the time of the Gracchi to the establishment of the monarchy under
Augustus, were contests in which the rich and the powerful were constantly
struggling among themselves for political supremacy; there
was an acknowledged aristocratical and an acknowledged popular
party. But the leaders of both parties, with perhaps some few exceptions,
were mainly bent on personal aggrandisement. The aristocratical
class had a clearer object than the leaders of the popular party:
they wished to maintain the power of their order and that of the senate,
which was the administering body. The leaders of the popular party
could have no clear object in view except the destruction of the power
of the senate: the notion of giving the people more power than they
possessed would have been an absurdity. Accordingly the depression
of the aristocratical body had for a necessary consequence the elevation
of an individual to power, as in the case of Cæsar the dictator. Sulla,
it is true, was an aristocrat, and he destroyed so far as he could the
popular party; but he made himself dictator, and to the last day of his
life he ruled all parties with a rod of iron.
</p><p>
The existence of a numerous and needy class who participated in
political power without having any property which should be a
guarantee for their honest use of it, was the stuff out of which grew the
revolutions of Rome. There was a crowded city population, clamorous,
for cheap bread, for grants of land, for public shows and amusements,
averse to labour, constantly called into political activity by the annual
elections, always ready to sell their votes to the best bidders; and a
class always ready to use this rabble as a tool for their political and
personal aggrandisement. Machiavelli observes (<i>Istor. Fiorent.</i> iii.)
that the natural enmity which exists between the men of the popular
party and the nobles (gli uomini Populari e i Nobili), proceeds from the
wish of the nobles to command and of the others not to obey, and that
these are the causes of all the evils that appear in states. He adds (iv.)
that states, and especially those that are not well constituted, which
are administered under the name of republics, often change their
government and condition, but the fluctuation is not between liberty
and servitude, as many suppose, but between servitude and licence. It
is only the name of liberty which is in the mouths of the ministers of
licence who are the popular leaders, and the ministers of servitude who
are the nobles; both of them wish to be subject neither to the laws nor
to men. These remarks, which are peculiarly applicable to Florence
and the so-called republics of Italy of that time, apply equally to the
Roman state. There are governments, however, to which the name
republic can be properly applied, and that of Great Britain is one, which
owing to the possession of certain elements have a more stable character.
Still the general character of a popular and of an aristocratical party is
correctly sketched by Machiavelli.</p></div>

dagger contained in a wooden case, a kind of sword-stick. (See
Facciolati, <i>Lexicon</i>.) Kaltwasser describes it as a walking-stick
containing a dagger, and translates the passage, “he provided himself
with a robbers’ dagger, without making any secret of it.” I think that
he wore it concealed, but made no secret of it, which agrees better with
the whole context; and Amyot has translated it so.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> The word in Plutarch is water jars, <i>hydriai</i> (ὑδρίαι), the Roman
sitellæ, urnæ or orcæ. The sitellæ were a kind of jar with a narrow
neck: they were filled with water so that the wooden lots (sortes) would
float at the top, and only one could be there at a time. These lots were
used for the purpose of determining in what order the tribes or centuries
should vote, for the names of the several tribes or centuries were on the
several lots. The vessel into which the voters put their votes (tabellæ),
when the order of voting had been fixed for the tribes and centuries,
was called cista; and it was a basket of wicker-work or something of
the kind, of a cylindrical shape. If Plutarch has used the proper word
here, the preliminary proceedings were disturbed by the rich seizing or
throwing down the vessels, out of which were to be drawn the lots for
determining in what order the tribes should vote. The business had
not yet got so far as the voting, which consisted in the voters depositing
in a cista one of the tablets (tabellæ), which were distributed among
them for this purpose, and which were marked with an appropriate
letter to express acceptance of a measure or rejection of it. There is a
Roman denarius which represents a man going to put a tabella into a
cista: the tabella is marked A, which means Absolvo, I acquit. The
letter C (Condemno, I condemn) was marked on the tabella of condemnation.
(Eckhel, <i>Doctr. Num. Vet.</i> V. 166.) The coin was struck to
commemorate the carrying of a law by L. Cassius Longinus <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 137,
by which the voting in criminal trials (judicia populi) except for
perduellio (treason) should be by ballot and not as before by word of
mouth.
</p><p>
These remarks are taken from an essay by Wunder (<i>Variæ Lectiones
&amp;c. ex Codice Erfurtensi</i>), in which he has established the meaning of
sitella and cista respectively to be that which Manutius long ago
maintained. He observes that in the Roman comitia one sitella would
be sufficient, as it was only used for receiving the names of the tribes or
centuries, which were put in for the purpose of determining by drawing
them out, in what order the tribes or centuries should vote. And
accordingly he says that when comitia are spoken of, we never find urns
or sitellæ spoken of in the plural number. But he has not mentioned
the passage of Plutarch. It may be difficult to determine if Plutarch
considered that the preliminary lot-drawing had been gone through,
and the people were voting. If he considered the voting to be going on,
he has used the wrong word. With this explanation, I leave the
word “voting-urns” in the text, which is not the correct Roman word
but may be what Plutarch meant. It seems as if he thought that the
voting had commenced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> From this it appears that the vote of each tribe counted as one,
and the vote of the tribe was determined by the majority of voters in
each tribe. It seems to follow that each tribe had a cista to receive its
votes. It is said, the practice was to count the votes when all was
over; but they must have been counted as each tribe voted, according
to this story. The narrative of Appian is the same (<i>Civil Wars</i>, i. 12).</p></div>

it likely that it is a fabrication of any professed speech-writer. It is
true that there were many speeches extant among the Romans, which,
though mere rhetorical essays, were attributed to persons of note and
passed off as genuine speeches. But this is either not one of them,
or it has been managed with consummate art. The defence of Tiberius
is a blot on his character. He could not avoid knowing that his arguments
were unsound. To abdicate, which means to resign a Roman
magistracy, was a different thing from being deprived of it. The
Tribunes were elected at the Comitia Tributa, but they derived their
powers by uninterrupted succession from the consecrated act (Lex
Sacrata) done on the Holy Mount and confirmed after the overthrow of
the Decemviral power. (Livius, 2, c. 33; 3, c. 55.) On this subject, see

their fields and could not come to the election, which thus would be in
the hands of the townspeople. If Tiberius was killed in July and

of this fragment with the passages from the speeches of
Tiberius Gracchus, which are given by Plutarch, is sufficient to show
that Plutarch’s extracts are genuine. There appears to be an error
in Plutarch as to the “three years.” Gellius makes Caius say: “Biennium

The people did not mount on the house-tops to vote, as Amyot and

who had no votes; they came to see and to affect the elections if they
could. Caius was elected tribune <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 123, just ten years after his
brother’s tribunate. The consuls were Quintus Cæcilius Metellus
Balearicus, a son of Metellus Macedonicus, an opponent of Tiberius

the powerful eloquence of Caius Gracchus. Up to the time of Cicero,
the orations of Gracchus were the models of oratory which all Romans
studied. Cicero says that his speeches did not receive the finishing
touch; he left behind him many things which were well begun, but not
perfected. The practice of revising speeches for the purpose of publication
was common among the Athenian and Roman orators. In manly

we look for his equal?</p></div>

to which however there is no objection. Plutarch uses the word “law;”
but the Roman word is “Rogatio,” which means a Bill, a proposed Law,
so called because the form of passing a law was to ask (rogare) the
assembly if they would have it. The form of voting was to reject
(antiquare) by the formula A., or to confirm (jubere) by the formula
U.R. (Uti Rogas), “as you propose,” which were marked on the tabellæ
or voting-tablets. (Cicero, <i>Ad Attic.</i> i. 14.)
</p><p>
To Promulgate a law, or more properly a Rogation, signified among
the Romans, to make public (for promulgare is only another form of

make known a law which is already a law; but the expression is not
much used.</p></div>

The Roman allies (Socii) were subjects of the Roman State, subject
to the sovereign power of Rome, a power which was distributed among
many members. They bore heavy burdens, particularly in the form of
supplies of men and money for war; and they claimed as an indemnification
the citizenship (civitas), or admission to the sovereign body, as
members of it. The claim was finally settled by the Marsic or Social
war. (See Marius and Sulla.)
</p><p>
The law about the price of grain belonged to the class of Laws which
the Romans called Frumenteriæ Leges, or Corn Laws; the object of
these laws was not to keep up the price of grain, but to furnish it to the
poor at a low rate. This low rate however was not effected in the only
way in which such an object could profitably be effected, by allowing
corn to come to Rome from all parts free of duty, but by buying grain
with the Public money and selling it to the poor at a lower rate. This
law of Gracchus proposed that corn should be sold to the people (plebs)
monthly at the rate of 5/6 of the As for a modius. This is the first
recorded instance in Roman History of the poor being relieved in this
manner. The city was crowded with poor who had few or no means of
subsistence, but had votes in the annual elections and were members of
the sovereign body. The consequences of such a measure might be
easily foreseen: the treasury became exhausted, and the people were
taught to depend for their subsistence, not on their industry, but on
these almost gratuitous distributions of grain. This allowance, which
was made monthly, added to the sale of their votes at the annual elections
and the distributions on extraordinary occasions, of corn and oil
(Dion Cassius, 43, c 31) helped a poor Roman to live in idleness.
This system of distributions of corn, sometimes free of cost, being once
established was continued all through the Republic and under the
Empire. It was impossible to stop the evil, when it had been rooted,
and in the crowded city of Rome under the Empire, it was an important
duty of the adminstration to prevent famine and insurrection by
provisioning the city. C. Julius Cæsar reduced the number of those
who received this corn relief from 320,000 to 150,000. The number
of receivers must have increased again, for Augustus reduced the
number to 200,000. This subject of the distribution of corn among the
poor is an important element in the history of the later Republic.
Dureau de la Malle (<i>Économie Politique des Romains</i>, ii. 307) has
compared it with the English mode of providing for the poor by the
Poor Laws; but though there are some striking points of resemblance
between the two systems, there are many differences, and the matter
requires to be handled with more knowledge and judgment than
this writer has shown in order to exhibit it in its proper light.
</p><p>
Plutarch’s account of the changes made by Gracchus in the body
of the Judices is probably incorrect. The law of Gracchus related to
trials for offences, such as bribery at elections (ambitus), and corruption
in the administration of offices (repetundæ), which belong to the
class of trials called at a later time judicia publica or public trials.
In the trials for these offences, those who had to decide on the guilt
or innocence of the accused, were called judices; and the judices were
taken only from the senators. But as the persons accused of offences,
of the kind above mentioned generally belonged to the senatorian
order, it was found very difficult to get a man convicted. Some
notorious instances of acquittals of persons, who had been guilty of
corruption, had occurred just before Gracchus proposed his law.
According to Appian, his law gave the judicial power solely to the
equites, who formed a kind of middle class between the senators and
the people. But the equites were not a safe body to intrust with this
power. To this body belonged the publicani, or publicans as they are
called in our translation of the Gospels (<i>Matt.</i>, ch. v., v. 47), who farmed
the revenues in the provinces. A governor who winked at the extortion
of the farmers of taxes would easily be acquitted, if he was tried for
maladministration on his return to Rome. The equites at Rome had
an interest in acquitting a man who favoured their order. Cicero
remarks (<i>In Verrem</i>, Act Prima, 13) that the judices were selected out
of the equites for near fifty years until the functions were restored to
the senate. He is alluding to the change Sulla made <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 83; but it
appears that there were some intermediate changes. Cicero adds that
during all this time there was never the slightest suspicion of any
eques taking a bribe in the discharge of his functions as judex.
Appian says that they soon became corrupt; and Cicero, who is
in the habit of contradicting himself, says in effect the same thing
(<i>In Verrem</i>, lib. iii. 41; <i>Brutus</i>, c. 34). The judices of Gracchus
condemned Opimius, whose character Cicero admired. (See <a href="#d18" class="pginternal">c. 18</a>, notes.)
The condemnation was either honest or dishonest: if honest, Cicero
is a dishonest man for complaining of the sentence (<i>Pro Plancio</i>, c.
29): if dishonest then Cicero here contradicts what he has said
elsewhere. (See also <i>In Pisonem</i>, c. 39.)
</p><p>
I have used the Roman word judices, which is the word that
Plutarch has translated. These judices were selected out of the
qualified body by lot (at least this was the rule sometimes) for each
particular trial. A judge, generally the prætor, presided, and the
guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by the judices by a
majority of votes; the votes were given by ballot at this time.
</p><p>
This law of Gracchus about the judicia is a difficult subject, owing
to the conflicting evidence.</p></div>

died B.C. 159, six years before Caius was tribune. He had retired to
rest in the evening with some tablets on which he intended to write a
speech to deliver before the people on the subject of the Agrarian Law
of Tiberius Gracchus and the difficulties of carrying it into effect. He
was found dead in the morning, and it was the general opinion that he
was murdered. His wife Sempronia was suspected, and even Cornelia
his mother-in-law, as well as C. Gracchus. C. Papirius Carbo, one of the
triumviri for dividing the land with Caius and Fulvius Flaccus is distinctly
mentioned by Cicero as one of the murderers. As to him, there
is no doubt that he was believed to be guilty. It is also admitted by all
authorities that there was no inquiry into the death of Scipio; and
Appian adds that he had not even a public funeral.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> This was the first Roman colony that was established beyond the
limits of the Italian Peninsula, which Velleius reckons among the most
impolitic measures of Gracchus. The colony of Gracchus appears to
have been neglected, and the town was not built. At the destruction
of Carthage heavy imprecations were laid on any man who should
restore the city. The colony was established by Cæsar the Dictator.
</p><p>
The foundation of a Roman colony was accompanied with solemn
ceremonials, to which Plutarch alludes. The anniversary day of the
foundation was religiously observed. On some Roman coins there is a
representation of a man driving a yoke of oxen and a vexillum
(standard), which are the symbols of a Roman colony.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_106_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106_106" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> Plutarch has here used the word oligarch (ὀλιγαρχικός), one who
is a friend to the party of the Few as opposed to the Many. The
meaning of an oligarchy, according to Aristotle (<i>Politik</i>, 4, c. 4), is a
government in which the rich and those of noble birth possess the
political power, being Few in number. But the smallness of the
number is only an accident: the essence of an oligarchy consists in the
power being in the hands of the rich and the noble, who happen in all
countries to be the Few compared with the Many.</p></div>

were given. Sardinia, it is said, was noted for a bitter herb which contracted
the features of those who tasted it. Pausanias (x. 17) says it is
a plant like parsley, which grows near springs, and causes people who
eat it to laugh till they die; and he supposes that Homer’s expression
(<i>Odyssey</i> xx. 302), a Sardanian laugh, is an allusion to this property of
the plant: but this is not a probable explanation of the expression in
Homer.</p></div>

great difficulty in determining if they are genuine, and opinions are

Spalding and Bernhardy. The Fragments are collected by Roth.</p></div>

(γραφεῖον), “a writing instrument,” was of metal, iron or brass, sharp
at one end and flat at the other. The point was used for writing on
tablets which were smeared with wax: the other end was used for
erasing what was written and making the surface even again. The
word was often used by the best Roman writers in a metaphorical sense
to express the manner and character of a written composition, and from
them it has passed into some of the modern languages of Europe, our
own among the rest: thus we speak of a good style, a bad style of
writing, and so on.</p></div>

detrimenti capiat (Livius, 3, c. 4), which empowered the consuls or
consul, as the case might be, to provide that the commonwealth sustained
no damage. The word detrimentum, which signifies damage caused
by rubbing off, had a tacit reference to the majestas of the Populus
Romanus. The majestas (majesty) of the state is its integrity, its
wholeness, any diminution of which was an offence; and under the
Emperors the crime of majestas, that is majestas impaired, was equivalent
to high treason. The decree here alluded to was only adopted, as
Livius expresses it, in the utmost extremity, when the state was in
danger; its effect was to proclaim martial law, and to suspend for the
time all the usual forms of proceeding.</p></div>

filled with lead, and that Septimuleius had been a confidential friend
of Caius. This was the first instance in Rome of head money being
offered and paid; but the example was followed in the proscriptions of
Sulla, and those of the triumviri Lepidus, M. Antonius, and Cæsar

<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 121, the year of the death of Caius. The history of his conduct in
Libya is told by Sallustius in the Jugurthine war. He was one of ten
commissioners who were sent, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 112, to settle the disputes between
Adherbal, the son of Micipsa, and Jugurtha, the illegitimate son of
Micipsa’s brother. The commissioners were bribed by Jugurtha and
decided in his favour. Opimius and the rest of them were tried for the
offence, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 109, and banished. Opimius died in great poverty at
Dyrrachium (Durazzo) in Epirus. (Sallustius, <i>Jugurthine War</i>, c. 134;
Velleius, ii. 7.) Cicero thinks that Opimius was very hardly used after
his services in crushing the insurrection at Fregellæ and putting down
the disturbances excited by Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus: he
calls him the saviour of the state, and laments his condemnation.

comprehended many objects, the provisions as to which are comprehended
under the general name of Semproniæ Leges, for it was the
fashion to name a law after the gentile name of him who proposed it.
The most important of the measures of Caius have been mentioned
by Plutarch, with the exception of a law about the provinces. At the
outbreak of the Social War, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 91, the Roman provinces comprehended
Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, the Spanish Peninsula, the whole of
which, however, was not subdued, Cisalpine Gaul, Asia, Macedonia,
Achæa, Transalpine Gaul, and some others of less note.
</p><p>
The original sense of the word provincia had no reference to a
territory, though this is the later sense of the word and the common
usage of it. The functions of the prætor urbanus who stayed at Rome
were called his provincia, that is, the administration of justice was his
provincia or business. The word is used in the sense of a function or
office by Livius with reference to a time when there was no provincia
in the later sense of the word. In the time of Cicero, provincia
signified a territory out of Italy, which was administered by a Roman
governor. The term Italy, at this time, did not comprise the whole
peninsula, but only that part which was south of the rivers Rubico and
Macra. The primary meaning of the word is confirmed by its etymology;
provincia is a shortened form of providentia, which also
appears in the shape prudentia. Providentia signifies “foresight,”
“superintending care,” and so forth; and it is formed on the same
principle as beneficentia, benevolentia, and other Latin words which
are of a participial character. The etymology of Niebuhr (proventus) is
untenable, and that which I have partly adopted (Smith’s <i>Dict. of
Antiquities</i>, art. “Provincia”) is no better. Since writing that article,
I saw that the word is only another form of providentia, and a friend
has pointed out to me that Mr. G. C. Lewis first suggested this as the
origin of the word in his Essay on the Government of Dependencies,
London, 1841, Note H. p. 353. If this explanation of the word is
correct, the true orthography is provintia, but I have not yet been able
to find it on an inscription.
</p><p>
The old practice was for the Senate, after the elections of the Consuls
and Prætors, to name two provinces which should be given to the
consuls after the consulship was expired. The two consuls settled by
lot or by agreement which province of the two they should have. As
the consuls were chosen before the two consular provinces were determined
by the senate, it was in the power of the senate to give what provinces
they pleased to the consuls, and so make the appointment either
a favour or not. A law of Gracchus enacted that the two consular
provinces should be determined before the election of consuls, and
that the senate should not have the power, which they had formerly
exercised, of prolonging a man’s government in a province beyond the
year. This law manifestly limited the power of the Senate, though
some writers conceive that it was enacted for the advantage of that
body as some compensation for their loss of the judicial power.
</p><p>
Plutarch has treated the subject of the Gracchi with perfect
impartiality. He has given them credit for good motives, and
approved of their measures in general, but he has not disguised their
faults. Appian considered that the measures of Tiberius were for the
public good, but that his conduct was not judicious. Sallustius also
admits that the Gracchi did not conduct themselves with sufficient
moderation (<i>Jugurthine War</i>, c. 46); but Sallustius belonged to the
popular party, and he approved of their measures. Most of the other
Roman writers express an unfavourable opinion of the Gracchi. Florus
however gives them credit for good intentions, but disapproves of the
means by which they attempted to carry their measures into effect.
That part of the work of Livius which treated of this period is lost,
but we may collect his opinions of the Gracchi from the Epitomes
of the lost books, and the general tenor of his History. The
measures of the Gracchi were estimated by the rule of party spirit.
The judgment of Cicero, who often mentions the Gracchi, is both for
and against. His expressed opinion, whatever might be his real
opinion, varied with circumstances. If we only knew his opinion from
the second oration against the Agrarian Law of Rullus (ii. 5), we should
consider him as approving of all the measures of the Gracchi. When
he delivered that oration, Cicero had just been elected Consul: he was
a Novus homo, a new man as the Romans called him, who was the first
of his family to attain to the high honours of the State, and he had
obtained the consulship as a friend of the people, as a popular
man (Popularis). In his treatise on Friendship and other of
his writings, he gives a contradictory judgment of the Gracchi; he
says that Tiberius Gracchus aimed at the kingly power, or rather in
fact was king for a few months; he calls the two Gracchi degenerate
sons of their father; he extols the murderers of Tiberius Gracchus; he
commiserates the hard fate of Opimius after saving the state by putting
Caius Gracchus to death. All this was written or said after he was
consul, after he had done what the murderers of the Gracchi had done,
after he had put to death Catilina and his accomplices without trial
contrary to the constitution, contrary to a special law which Caius
Gracchus had carried that no Roman citizen should be put to death
without a duly constituted trial; after he had, like Nasica and Opimius,
made himself a murderer by putting men to death without letting them
be tried according to law; whether they were guilty or not, is immaterial;
they were put to death without trial, contrary to a principle of
justice which, before he became guilty himself, Cicero had maintained
and defended. The acts of the Gracchi were on record and well
understood; but Cicero made his opinion of their acts depend not on
his convictions, but on his interests; it is to him mainly that we may
trace the common notion that the Gracchi were merely a couple of
designing demagogues. The Gracchi were not wise enough or firm
enough to be good reformers, but few reformers in so difficult a situation
have left behind them so fair a reputation for honest intention.
There was a great mass of contemporary materials for the history of
the Gracchi, consisting of the speeches of the two brothers, of the
numerous speeches made against them, the history of Polybius, who
could not have overlooked the Gracchi in his account of the Numantine
war, the history of Fannius, and other materials which Gerlach has
enumerated in his Essay on the Gracchi. It is plain from Plutarch’s
narrative, that he used these authorities; and if we consider how far
removed he was from the time of the Gracchi, and his character, we
may conclude that he has given as impartial a view of the times as he
could collect from contemporary evidence. He may have made mistakes,
and some mistakes we cannot help considering that he has made; but
he can hardly have made any mistake in his representation of the
nature of the reforms which the two brothers attempted, of the opposition
that they encountered, and of their general character.</p>

first person who is mentioned as bearing the name of Cicero is
C. Claudius Cicero, a tribunus plebis, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 454 (Liv. 3. c. 31).
M. Tullius Cicero, the grandfather of the orator, was born <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 140,
and nothing is known of the orator’s family before him. Arpinum
received the limited Roman civitas in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 303 (Liv. 10. c. 1), that is,

the greater part of his life on his lands at Arpinum, near the junction
of the Fibrenus with the Liris (Garigliano). He afterwards removed
to Rome to educate his sons Marcus and Quintus, and had a house in
the Carinæ. Among his friends were the orators M. Antonius and
Lucius Crassus, and Q. Scævola the Augur, a distinguished Jurist.
His sons had accordingly the advantage of being acquainted in their
youth with some of the most distinguished of the Romans. He is said
to have died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 64, the year before his son was consul. A letter of
Cicero to Atticus (i. 6) is generally supposed to speak of his father’s
death, but the true reading is undoubtedly “pater a nobis discessit;”
and it is plain that Cicero is simply speaking of his father leaving
Rome for a time (Drumann, <i>Tullii</i>, p. 213).</p></div>

or from some other accidental circumstance. The mark on the
nose is just as likely to be the origin of the name as the cultivation of
the <i>cicer</i>; for if the name Fabius comes from <i>faba</i>, “a bean,” and
Lentulus, from <i>lens</i>, “pulse;” yet Catulus means “a whelp,” and
Scaurus means “knock-knee’d,” or something of the kind.

The words διαστόλη, διαφύη mean what I have translated them.
Kaltwasser has translated the passage thus, according to Reiske’s
explanation:—“Jener hatte an der spitze der nase einen kleinen
anwuchs oder warze in form einer solchen erbse, woven er den beinamen
erhielt.” But this is not a translation. Plutarch does not say
that he had a wart at the end of his nose, but that the end of his
nose was like a vetch, because there was a kind of split or cleft in it.
There is no reason for misrepresenting even a man’s nose.</p></div>

Claudius Æsopus, the great tragic actor, whom Cicero considered a
perfect master of his art, was probably a Greek and a freedman
of some member of the Claudia Gens. He was liberal in his
expenditure, and yet he acquired an enormous fortune, which his
son spent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_157_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157_157" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> Cicero tells the story himself in his oration for Cn. Plancius (c.
26). The place of the adventure was Puteoli (Pozzuoli), <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 74, a
place to which the Romans used to resort to enjoy the natural hot
springs and the agreeable neighbourhood.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> Verres during his prætorship in Sicily, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 73-71, had greatly misconducted
himself. He was prosecuted in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 70, in which year Pompeius
Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus were consuls (Life of Crassus,
c. 12). Hortensius, the orator, defended Verres. The object of Hortensius
and of these praetors was to prolong or defer the trial to the
next year, for which Hortensius was elected consul.
</p><p>
There are extant seven orations of Cicero on the matter of Verres,
of which two only were delivered; that against Cæcilius (<i>De Divinatione</i>),
who claimed to conduct the prosecution, his object being to get
Verres off, and the Actio Prima, which is an opening of the whole
case. Before the other speeches were delivered, Verres gave up his
defence and went into exile. Cicero, however, published the speeches,
or probably even wrote them entire after the affair was over.
</p><p>
This Cæcilius was Q. Cæcilius Metellus, a Sicilian by birth, and
probably the descendant of a freedman of one of the Metelli. It seems
that he was suspected of being of Jewish origin. Cicero’s allusion to
the hog, and many other passages in the Roman writers, show that the
Jews were well known in Rome at this time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_161_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_161" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> There is probably some error in Plutarch as to the amount. In
the Divinatio (c. 5) the peculations of Verres were estimated at
“millies HS.,” or one hundred millions of sesterces; but in the Actio
Prima (c. 18), which was spoken after Cicero had been in Sicily to
collect evidence, he put the amount at forty millions of sesterces, or
two-fifths of the first sum. If Plutarch’s drachmæ are Roman denarii,
his 750,000 drachmæ will make only three millions of sesterces.
</p><p>
Verres continued in exile, and he remained quiet during the civil
wars. Though an unprincipled scoundrel, he showed his taste in
stealing: he had kept many valuable objects of art, and he would
not part with them. The story is that M. Antonius put his name in
the proscription list, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 43, because he would not give up his
Corinthian vessels. He was put to death, but he died, it is said, with
great resolution; and he had the satisfaction of hearing that his old
enemy Cicero had gone before him (Drumann, <i>Tullii</i>, p. 328). But all
this story is very improbable.</p></div>

preside at the trials for Repetundæ. This Macer was C. Licinius
Macer. After he had been prætor he had a province, and during his
administration he was guilty of illegal practices, for which he was
tried and convicted (Cic. <i>Ad Attic.</i> i. 4). Crassus, who also belonged
to the Licinia Gens, felt some sympathy for a man whose crime was
getting money by unlawful means. Macer was an orator and a writer.
A few fragments of his Annals (Krause, <i>Vitæ et Fragm. Vet. Histor.

speech of Cicero against him, in which of course he has a very bad
character given to him. Kaltwasser says that a thick neck was
considered by the Romans as a sign of a shameless man, and he refers
to the Life of Marius, c. 29, where a like expression is used. Cicero’s
neck, according to his own account, was very thin, and he thought
it no good sign of his strength. However this may be as to the
thickness of the neck of Vatinius, it was clearly not a thing that he
could alter.</p></div>

and carried the law which gave Pompeius the command in the
Mithridatic war, and Cicero had supported the measure in a speech
which is extant (Life of Pompeius, c. 30). This story of the accusation
and defence of Manilius is unintelligible. C. Orchinius presided at
the trials for peculatus, and Manilius should have been brought before
him (Cic. <i>Pro Cluentio</i>, c. 53). See Dion Cassius, 36. c. 27; and

took the opportunity of getting all the money that he could. He gave
it out that Cicero was to have a share of it. The evidence of such an
unprincipled man is not worth much; but one of Cicero’s letters to
Atticus (i. 12), which he never expected would be read by anybody
else, shows that he knew there was such a rumour; and the manner
in which he treats it is perfectly incomprehensible. A certain Hilarus,
a freedman of Cicero, was then with Antonius in Macedonia, as Cicero
was informed, and Cicero was also informed that Antonius declared
that Cicero was to have some of the money that he was getting, and
that Hilarus had been sent by Cicero to look after his share. Cicero
was a good deal troubled, as he says, though he did not believe the
report; yet, he adds, there was certainly some talk. Cn. Plancius was
named to Cicero as the authority for the report. Atticus is requested
to examine into the matter, and—not to apply to Antonius or to
Plancius—but to get the rascal (Hilarus) out of those parts, if in any
way he can. This is a mode of proceeding that is quite inconsistent
with perfect innocence on the part of Cicero. There was something
between him and Antonius. Cicero says that if Antonius should be
recalled, as was expected, he could not for his character’s sake defend
the man; and what is more, he says, he felt no inclination; and then
he proceeds to tell Atticus about this awkward report. Yet Cicero did
defend Antonius (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 59) and Antonius was convicted.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_174_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_174_174" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> It appears from Cicero’s oration for Murena, c. 19, that his name
was Lucius Roscius Otho, and he was not Prætor, but Tribunus Plebis.
This Lex Roscia was enacted <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 67, in the consulship of M. Acilius
Glabrio and C. Calpurnius Piso (Don Cassius, 36. c. 25). His law
gave to the equites and those who had the equestrian census a select
place of fourteen rows at the public spectacles, which were next to the
seats of the senators. This unpopular measure was that which Cicero
now spoke in favour of (<i>Ad. Attic.</i> ii. 1). Cicero’s oration is lost, but
a passage is preserved, says Kaltwasser, by Macrobius (<i>Saturnalia</i> ii.
10). Some also suppose, as Kaltwasser says, that Virgil alludes to it in
the passage in the Aeneid (i. 152). There is no extract from this oration
in Macrobius, who appears to suppose that Cicero made an oration to
rebuke the people for making a disturbance while Roscius, the player,
was acting.</p></div>

capite, alterum firmum, sine capite: huic, cum ita de se meritum
esset, caput se vivo non defuturum.” Cicero makes Catiline say that
the weak body had a weak head. Cicero’s version of what he said is
obviously the true one.</p></div>

Vargunteius. See the note of Drumann, <i>Tullii</i>, p. 457: “Plutarch
hunted in his authorities only after anecdotes and traits of character
in order to paint his heroes: the names of the subordinate persons
were indifferent to him; with such frivolous and one-sided views
he could not fail to confound persons.” “Frivolous,” is perhaps
hardly the translation of Drumann’s “leichtsinnig,” but it comes
pretty near to it. And yet the fact of the design to assassinate is
the main feature in the history: the actors in the intended assassination
are subordinate to the design. A painstaking compiler is entitled
to grumble at such a blunder, but Plutarch does not merit reproach in
these terms.</p></div>

Gallia Narbonensis. Their chief town was Vienna, now Vienne.
According to Cæsar’s description (<i>Bell. Gall.</i> i. 6.) the Rhodanus in the
upper part of its course separated the Helvetii from the Allobroges.
The remotest town of the Allobroges, on the side of the Helvetii, was
Geneva. Cæsar describes the Allobroges as recently (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 58) brought

Plutarch means to say, that if Cæsar had been accused as a member
of the conspiracy, he would have been acquitted, and the conspirators
would have had a chance of escaping also. There was no chance of
securing the condemnation of the conspirators and involving Cæsar in
their fate. On the contrary, if Cæsar was accused, all might escape.
It was better, therefore, not to touch him. Kaltwasser has made the
passage unintelligible. The explanation of Coraës, as corrected by
Schäfer, is right.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_195_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_195_195" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> Sallustius (<i>Bell. Cat.</i> c. 51, &amp;c.) states Cæsar’s proposal to have
been the confiscation of the property of the conspirators and their
perpetual confinement in the chief municipia of Italy, and that the
Senate should make a declaration that any man who proposed to set
them at liberty, or to mitigate their punishment, should be considered
an enemy of the State. Cicero (<i>In Catilin.</i> iv. 5) states the opinion of
Cæsar to the same effect. Cæsar had urged the illegality of condemning
Roman citizens to death without a trial, and this was provided by
a Lex Sempronia of C. Gracchus. But Cicero replies that Cææar’s
measure was as severe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_197_197"></a><a href="#FNanchor_197_197" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[197]</span></a> Plutarch likens the feelings of the youth at the sight of the
prisoners being led to execution to the solemn ceremonies of initiation
in some mysterious rites. The conspirators were taken to the only
prison that Rome then had, the Tullianum, where they were strangled.
Five men were put to death. Nine had been condemned to death, but
four had escaped being seized. Appian (<i>Civil Wars</i>, ii. 6) seems to
say that Cicero saw the men put to death. If he did not see the execution,
we may safely assume that he took care to see that the men really
were dead. Their bodies were delivered to their kinsfolk for interment.</p></div>

The battle was fought early in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 62, probably near Pistoria (Pistoia)
in Etruria. It was a bloody struggle, hand to hand, and the loss on
the victorious side was great. Dion says that Antonius sent the head
of Catilina to Rome. According to Roman usage, he was entitled to
the honour of the victory, because Petreius was his inferior officer.</p></div>

functions on the tenth of December. The consuls began to exercise
their functions on the first of January. The oath that Cicero had to
swear was, that he had obeyed the laws. He alludes to the oath that
he did swear on the last day of December on giving up his office, in a
letter to Q. Metellus Celer, the brother of Nepos (<i>Ad Diversos</i>, v. 2),
and in his oration against Piso, c. 3. Manutius (<i>Comment. in</i> Cic. Ep.
<i>Ad Divers.</i> v. 2) shows that Bestia was a tribune during Cicero’s
consulship, and as he had gone out of office on the ninth of December
he could not have acted with Metellus on the thirty-first of December.

his son, then at Athens (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 44), Cicero speaks of the youth having
then been a year under the instruction of Kratippus. Kratippus was
a native of Mitylene, and he was living there when Pompeius touched
at the island after the battle of Pharsalia (Life of Pompeius, c. 75).
Cicero’s son was attached to his master, and in an extant letter to Tiro
(Cic. <i>Ad Diversos</i>, xvii. 21) he expresses his affection for him. Kratippus
was more than a philosopher: he was a pleasant companion, and perhaps
young Cicero liked his table-talk as much as his philosophy.</p></div>

appears to have purposely expressed himself as if the Stoics considered

not “good,” because he was “rich.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_206_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_206_206" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[206]</span></a> This is a frigid joke. Axius in Greek (ἄξιος) signifies “worthy;”
and Cicero’s words literally translated are, he is “worthy of Crassus,”
if we take Axius as a Greek word. They can also mean, he is “Axius
son of Crassus.” The wit lay in associating the name of Axius and
Crassus; but the joke is only made duller by the explanation.

oldest of the three sisters. Quadranteria is a misprint for Quadrantaria.
This lady was the wife of Q. Metellus Celer, and was suspected
of poisoning him. Cicero vents unbounded abuse upon her; and he
also preserved the name Quadrantaria (<i>Or. Pro Cælio</i>, c. 26). The
Roman word Quadrans, a fourth, signified a fourth part of a Roman as,
and was a small copper coin. The way in which one of her lovers is
reported to have paid her in copper coin seems to have circulated in
Rome as a good practical joke.</p></div>

have been much engaged in public life, he lived in the opinion of
others. He did not follow the maxim of the Emperor Antoninus, who
bids us “Look within; for within is the source of good, and it sends
up a continuous stream to those who will always dig there” (vii. 59).
Cicero did not reverence his own soul, but he placed his happiness “in
the opinion of others” (i. 6). Perhaps however he was not weaker
than most active politicians, whose letters would be as dolorous and
lachrymose as his, if they were banished to a distant colony.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_237_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237_237" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> This is not obscure, if it is properly considered, and it contains a
serious truth. A man must view things as they are, and he must not
take his notions of them from the affects of the many. “Things touch
not the soul, but they are out of it, and passive; perturbations come
only from the opinion that is within a man” (M. Antoninus, iv. 3).

foro maximam faciunt, universique destrictis gladiis et cruentis in
omnibus fori partibus fratrem meum, virum optimum, fortissimum,
meique amantissimum oculis quaerebant, voce poscebant.” Cicero adds
that his brother being driven from the Rostra lay down in the Comitium,
and protected himself “with the bodies of slaves and freedmen;” by
which Cicero seems to mean that his slaves and freedmen kept watch
over him till he made his escape at night. Plutarch appears to have
misunderstood the passage or to have had some other authority. In
this dreadful tumult “the Tiber was filled with the dead bodies of the
citizens, the drains were choaked, and the blood was wiped up from
the Forum with sponges.” This looks somewhat like rhetorical
embellishment.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_240_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240_240" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> Cicero in a letter to Atticus (iv. 2) gives an account of the compensation
which he received. The valuation of his house at Rome
(superficies aedium) was fixed at HS. vicies, or two million sesterces.
He seems not to have objected to this, but he complains of the valuation
of his Tusculanum and Formianum.</p></div>

sole consul. Cicero’s speech for Milo is extant, or at least a speech
which he wrote after the trial. Milo was condemned and went an
exile to Massilia. His property was sold and it went cheap. Cicero
was under some suspicion of being a purchaser; but the matter is
quite unintelligible (Drumann, <i>Annii</i>, p. 49, and the references). There
could be no reason why Cicero should write in such obscure terms to
Atticus, if his conduct in this matter was fair.</p></div>

The proconsulship of Cicero was in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 51, though he had been consul
in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 63. Cicero went to Cilicia against his will (<i>Ad Diversos</i>, iii. 2).
Pompeius had got the Senate (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 52) to pass an order that no person
should hold a province within five years after being consul or prætor.
This was aimed at Cæsar, if he should get a second consulship. Pompeius
also wished to have Cicero out of the way, and the provinces were
to be supplied with governors from among those who did not come
within the terms of the new rule: and Cicero was one of them (Cicero,
<i>Ad Diversos</i>, iii. 2; <i>Ad Attic.</i> vi. 6).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_246_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246_246" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> He was the third Cappadocian king of this name. This unlucky
king was a debtor of Cn. Pompeius and M. Junius Brutus, the most
distinguished Roman money-lender of his day (Cicero, <i>Ad Attic.</i> vi.
1-3). Both Pompeius and Brutus were pressing the king for money.
Deiotarus also sent to Ariobarzanes to try to get some money out of
him for Brutus. The king’s answer was that he had none, and Cicero
says that he believed he told the truth, for that no country was in a
more impoverished state and nobody more beggared than the king.
Cicero dunned the king continually with letters, but he was not particularly
well pleased with his commission (<i>Ad Attic.</i> vi. 2). The end
was that the king provided for the payment of about one hundred
talents to Brutus during Cicero’s year of government. He had
promised Pompeius two hundred in six mouths, which, as a judicious
commentator remarks, is not worth so much as a security for one
hundred. These money doings of the supposed patriot Brutus should
be well examined by those who still retain an opinion of the virtues of
this Republican hero.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_247_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247_247" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> There seems no reason to doubt that Cicero’s administration of his
province was just and mild. Plutarch has apparently derived some of
the facts here mentioned from Cicero himself (<i>Ad Attic.</i> vi. 2): “Aditus
autem ad me minime provinciales; nihil per cubicularium: ante lucem
inambulabam domi, ut olim candidatus.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> Cicero’s exploits were such as would not have been recorded, if he
had not been his own historian. In a letter to Cato (<i>Ad Diversos</i>, xv.
4), he gives a pretty full account of his operations; and he asks Cato
to use his influence to get him the honour of a Supplicatio or Public
Thanksgiving. Cato’s short reply, which he says is longer than his
letters usually are, is a model in its way.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_249_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249_249" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> So it is in Plutarch’s text: it may be the blunder of Plutarch, or
the blunder of his copyists. The true name is M. Cælius (Cic. <i>Ad
Diversos</i>, ii. 11), who was curule ædile <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 51. The saying about the
panthers is in this letter of Cicero, who had set the panther-hunters to
work.
</p><p>
Cicero returned to Rome in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 50. He mentions (<i>Ad Attic.</i> vi. 7)
his intention to call at Rhodes.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_250_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_250_250" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> The events of this chapter, which belong to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 49, are told at
length in the Lives of Pompeius and Cæsar. Cicero’s irresolution is
well marked in his own letters; in one of which (<i>Ad Attic.</i> viii. 7,
referred to by Kaltwasser) he says:—“Ego quem fugiam habeo, quem
sequar non habeo.”
</p><p>
There are no letters extant of Trebatius to the purport which
Plutarch states, but Cæsar wrote to Cicero and begged him to stay at
Rome. Cicero (<i>Ad Attic.</i> ix. 16) has given a copy of Cæsar’s letter;
and a copy of another letter from Cæsar (<i>Ad Attic.</i> x. 8), in which he
urges Cicero to keep quiet. There seems to be no doubt that
Trebatius had been employed by Cæsar to write to Cicero and speak
to him about remaining neutral at least. Cicero had an interview with
Cæsar at Formiæ, after Cæsar’s return from Brundusium (<i>Ad
Atticum</i>, ix. 18, 19; <i>Ad Diversos</i>, iv. 1). The letter last referred to is
addressed to Servius Sulpicius.</p></div>

they ought not to require it. Cicero apparently meant to say that it
was as absurd to talk of men being dispirited after a victory, as if one
were to say that Cæsar’s friends disliked him.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_254_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_254_254" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> After defeating Pharnaces Cæsar landed in Italy, in September,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 47, of the unreformed calendar. Cicero had received a letter from
Cæsar before Cæsar’s arrival in Italy. The letter was written in
Egypt (Cicero, <i>Ad Diversos</i>, xiv. 23; <i>Pro Q. Ligario</i>, c. 3). Compare
Dion Cassius, 46, c. 12, 22, as to the conduct of Cicero to Cæsar.
Before the end of the year Cicero was in Rome.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_255_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255_255" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> It is difficult to see what was the resemblance between Perikles
and Cicero. Theramenes was somewhat more like him, for he tried to
be on more sides than one, and met with the usual fate of such people.
He was one of the so-called Thirty Tyrants of Athens, and he was
sacrificed by his colleagues.</p></div>

alludes to his occupations at Tusculum. He compares himself to
Dionysius, who after being driven from Syracuse is said to have opened
a school at Corinth. Cicero’s literary activity after <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 47 is the
most remarkable passage in his life. He required to be doing something.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_258_258"></a><a href="#FNanchor_258_258" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> The allusion is to the story of Laertes in the Odyssey, i. 190, and

to Terentia is dated on the first of October, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 47, from Venusia.
Cicero was then on his road from Brundusium to Tusculanum. He
orders his wife to have everything ready for him; some friends would
probably be with him, and they might stay some time. The bath was
to be got ready, and eatables, and everything else. A gentleman
would write a more civil letter to his housekeeper.
</p><p>
In a letter to Cn. Plancius (<i>Ad Diversos</i>, ix. 14), who congratulates
Cicero on his new marriage, he says that nothing would have induced
him to take such a step at such a time, if he had not found on his
return his domestic affairs even worse than public affairs. According
to his own account he was hardly safe in his own house, and it was
necessary to strengthen himself by new alliances against the perfidy
of old ones. Terentia may have been a bad housekeeper, and her
temper was not the sweetest. She could not have any feeling for her
husband except contempt, and he repaid it by getting rid of her.
Cicero had to repay the Dos of Terentia, but she never got it back, so
far as we can learn.
</p><p>
It is not known what was the age of Terentia when she was divorced,
but she could not be young. Yet there are stories of her marrying
Sallustius, the historian, and after him Messala Corvinus, but the
authority for these marriages is weak. She is said to have attained
the age of one hundred and three. Terentia had a large property of
her own. There is no imputation on her character, which, for those
times, is much in her favour. She had courage in danger and firmness
of purpose, both of which her husband wanted. “Her husband,” says
Drumann, “who always looked for and needed some support, must often
have acted under her influence: for him it was a fortunate thing
to have such a woman by his side, and a scandal that he put her
away.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_260_260"></a><a href="#FNanchor_260_260" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[260]</span></a> Her name was Publilia. Cicero was now sixty years of age.
Various ladies had been recommended to Cicero. He would not marry
the daughter of Pompeius Magnus, the widow of Faustus Sulla,
perhaps for fear that it might displease Cæsar; another who was
recommended to him was too ugly (<i>Ad Attic.</i> xiv. 11). Publilia was
young and rich: her father had left her a large fortune, but in order
to evade the Lex Voconia, which limited the amount that a woman
could take by testament, the property was given to Cicero in trust to
give it to her. The marriage turned out unhappy. In a letter to
Atticus (xiv. 32), written when Cicero was alone in the country, he
says that Publilia had written to pray that she might come to him
with her mother; but he had told her that he preferred being alone,
and he begs Atticus to let him know how long he could safely stay in
the country without a visit from his young wife. Tullia died in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
45, and Cicero had now no relief except in his studies; his new wife
was a burden to him, and he divorced her. He had the Dos of Publilia
now to repay, and Terentia was not settled with; thus, in addition to
his other troubles, he was troubled about money (<i>Ad Attic.</i>, xiv. 34,
47).
</p><p>
Dion Cassius (57. 15) says that Vibius Rufus, who was consul <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
22, in the time of Tiberius, married Cicero’s widow, and Middleton
supposes that Terentia is meant, but this is very unlikely; Dion must
mean Publilia.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_261_261"></a><a href="#FNanchor_261_261" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> Tiro was a freedman of Cicero, and had been brought up in his
house. He had a good capacity and his master was strongly attached
to him. Cicero’s letters to him are in the sixteenth book of the Miscellaneous
Collection. It is said that Tiro collected the letters of
Cicero after Cicero’s death, by doing which he has rendered a great
service to history, and little to his master.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_262_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_262_262" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[262]</span></a> Tullia’s first husband was C. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died
probably early in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 57. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 56 Tullia married Furius Crassipes,
from whom she was divorced, but the circumstances are not known.
Her third husband was P. Cornelius Dolabella, a patrician. It seems
that she was separated from Dolabella before she died. Tullia did not
die in Rome, but at her father’s house at Tusculum, in February, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
45. Tullia left one son by Dolabella, who was named Lentulus. His
father, Dolabella, is also named Lentulus, whence it is concluded that
he had been adopted by a Lentulus. The Lentuli were Cornelii.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_263_263"></a><a href="#FNanchor_263_263" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[263]</span></a> Cæsar was murdered on the Ides of March, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 44. The circumstances
of Cæsar’s death, and the events which follow, are told in the
Lives of Cæsar and Antonius. Cicero saw Cæsar fall (<i>Ad Attic.</i> xiv.
14), and he rejoiced.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_264_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_264_264" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> An “oblivion” or “non-remembrance” is a declaration of those
who have the sovereign power in a state, that certain persons shall be
excused for their political acts. It implies that those who grant the
amnesty have the power, and that those to whom it is granted are in
subjection to them, or have not the political power which the authors
of the amnesty assume. After Thrasybulus at Athens had overthrown
the Thirty Tyrants as they are called, an amnesty was declared, but
the Thirty and some few others were excluded from it (Xenophon,
<i>Hellen.</i> ii. 4, 38).
</p><p>
Cicero in his first Philippic (c. 1) alludes to his attempt to bring
about a settlement. The senate met on the eighteenth of March in
the temple of Tellus: “In quo templo quantum in me fuit jeci fundamenta
pacis, Atheniensiumque renovavi vetus exemplum: Græcum
etiam verbum usurpavi quo tum in sedandis discordiis erat usa civitas
illa, atque omnem memoriam discordiarum oblivione sempiterna
delendam censui.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_265_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_265" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> P. Cornelius Dolabella, once the husband of Tullia, Cicero’s
daughter. He was consul, after Cæsar’s death, with M. Antonius, and
in the next year, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 43, he was in Syria as governor. Cassius, who
was also in Syria, attacked Dolabella and took Laodicea, where Dolabella
was. To avoid falling into the hands of his enemy, Dolabella
ordered a soldier to kill him.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_266_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266_266" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> A. Hirtius, or as Plutarch writes the name Irtius, and C. Vibius
Pansa were the consuls of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 53. Cicero set out from Rome soon
after Cæsar’s death with the intention of going to Greece (<i>Ad Attic.</i>
xiv.). He went as far as Syracuse, whence he returned to Rome, which
he reached on the last day of August (<i>Ad Diversos</i>, xii. 25; <i>Ad Attic.</i>
xvi. 7; <i>Philipp.</i> i. 5; v. 7). Cicero in the passage last referred to
speaks of the violent measures of Antonius; “huc etiam nisi venirem
Kal. Sept. fabros se missurum et domum meam disturbaturum esse
dixit.” On the second of September he delivered his first Philippic in
the Senate. It is an evidence of Cicero’s great mental activity that he
wrote his Topica, addressed to Trebatius, on shipboard after he had set
sail from Velia with the intention of going to Greece. He says that
he had no books with him (<i>Topica</i>, c. 1, &amp;c.).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_267_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267_267" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> C. Octavius, the grandson of Cæsar’s younger sister Julia, and the
son of C. Octavius, prætor <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 61, by Atia, the daughter of M. Atius
Balbus and Julia. C. Octavius, the young Cæsar, was born <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 63,
in the consulship of Cicero. The dictator by his testament left him a
large property and his name. Accordingly he is henceforth called C.
Julius Cæsar Octavianus, but he is better known as the future
Emperor Augustus. At the time of the Dictator’s assassination he
was at Apollonia, a town on the coast of Illyricum. He came to Rome
on the news of Cæsar’s death with his friend M. Vipsanius Agrippa.
Cicero saw him at his Cuman villa on his way to Rome (<i>Ad. Attic.</i>
xiv. 11, 12).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_268_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_268" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> Plutarch probably means Greek drachmæ, for he states the sum
in his Life of Antonius, c. 15, in round numbers at 4000 talents. The
Septies Millies which Cicero speaks of (<i>Philipp.</i> ii. 37) is a different
sum of money.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> Cæsar’s mother had taken for her second husband L. Marcius
Philippus. She just lived to see her youthful son consul in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 43.
</p><p>
Octavia, the younger sister of Cæsar, was now the wife of C.
Marcellus, who had been consul <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 50. After the death of Marcellus,
she married M. Antonius (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 40), being then with child by her
deceased husband. The Roman law did not allow a woman to marry
till ten months after her husband’s death; the object of the rule was
to prevent the paternity of a child from being doubtful. Plutarch
correctly states the time at ten months (Life of Antonius, c. 31). If
Octavia was then with child, as Dion Cassius says (48. c. 3), the
reason for the rule did not exist. In later times, at least, the rule was
dispensed with when the reason for it ceased, as when a pregnant
widow was delivered of a child before the end of the ten months. Ten
months was the assumed time of complete gestation (Savigny, <i>System</i>,
&amp;c. ii. 181).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_270_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_270" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> Young Cæsar had raised troops in Campania, and chiefly at Capua
among the veteran soldiers of the dictator, who had been settled on
lands there (Dion Cassius, 45. c. 12; Cicero, <i>Ad Atticum</i>, xvi. 8). He
gave the men five hundred denarii apiece, about eighteen pounds
sterling, by way of bounty, and led them to Rome. These men were
old soldiers, well trained to their work. The youth who did this was
nineteen years of age, a boy, as Cicero calls him; but a boy who outwitted
him and everybody else, and maintained for more than half a
century the power which he now seized.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_271_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_271_271" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> Dreams were viewed in a sort as manifestations of the will of the
gods. This dream happened, as Dion Cassius tells (45. c. 2), to
Catulus; and he makes Cicero dream another dream. Cicero dreamed
that Octavius was let down from heaven by a chain of gold, and was
presented with a whip by Jupiter. Suetonius (<i>Octav. Cæsar</i>, c. 94)
agrees with Dion Cassius. The whip was significant. Jupiter meant
that somebody required whipping, and he put the whip in the hands of
a youth who knew how to use it.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_272_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_272_272" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> The young man cajoled the old one and made a tool of him. Like
all vain men, Cicero was ready to be used by those who knew how to
handle him. There is a letter from Brutus to Cicero (<i>Ad Brutum</i>, 16),
and one of Brutus to Atticus (<i>Ad Brutum</i>, 17), to the purport here
stated by Plutarch. But these letters may be spurious.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_273_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_273_273" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> He was at Athens in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 44, when Cicero addressed to him his
Officia. He had been a year there (<i>De Offic.</i> i. 1) at the time when
the first chapter was written. The poet Horatius was there at the
same time. When M. Brutus came to Athens in the autumn of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 44,
Cicero joined Brutus, who gave him a command in his cavalry
(Plutarch, <i>Brutus</i>, c. 24, 26).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_274_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_274_274" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[274]</span></a> The consuls were sent to relieve Mutina (Modena), in which
Decimus Brutus, the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, was besieged by
Antonius. Cicero had recommended the Senate to give Cæsar the
authority of a commander. Cæsar received a command with the
insignia of a prætor. There were two battles at Mutina, in April, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
43, in which the two consuls fell.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_275_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275_275" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> It is stated by various authorities that Cicero was cajoled with
the hopes of the consulship (Dion Cassius, 46. c. 42; Appian, <i>Civil
Wars</i>, iii. 82). The testimony of the tenth letter to Brutus (Cicero
<i>Ad Brutum</i>, 10) is not decisive against other evidence. Cæsar came
to Rome in August, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 43, with his army, and through the alarm
which he created, was elected consul with Q. Pedius (Dion Cassius,

Lavinius, as the name is in Appian (<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 2). The meeting
is also described by Dion Cassius (46. c. 45), and here they formed a
triumvirate for five years. The number of the proscribed, according
to Appian, was three hundred senators and two thousand equites. The
power of the triumvirate was confirmed at Rome in legal form (Appian,
<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 7).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_279_279"></a><a href="#FNanchor_279_279" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[279]</span></a> The circumstances of Cicero’s death are told more minutely by
Plutarch than by any other writer. He left the city before the arrival
of the Triumviri in November, and apparently when the bloody work
of the proscription had commenced. He had probably heard of his
fate before he reached Tusculum.</p></div>

Antium. Near Astura a small stream, Fiume Astura, flows into the

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_281_281"></a><a href="#FNanchor_281_281" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[281]</span></a> Appian (<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 20) says that the father told his murderers
to kill him first, his son did the same, on which they were parted and
murdered at the same time. Dion Cassius (47, c. 10) gives a different
story. The main fact that they were murdered is not doubtful, but, as
is usual, the circumstances are uncertain.</p></div>

which is the only striking feature on the coast of Latium.
The agony of Cicero’s mind is powerfully depicted in his irresolution.
The times were such as to make even a brave man timid, but a true
philosopher would have shown more resolution. His turning his steps
towards Rome and his return are not improbable. He had been doing
the same kind of thing all his life.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_283_283"></a><a href="#FNanchor_283_283" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> So in the text of Plutarch, but Caieta (Gaeta) is meant. Cicero
had a villa at Formiæ, near Caieta, his Formianum, which he often
mentions and which in his prosperous days was a favourite retreat.
</p><p>
The Appian road passed from Terracina through Fundi (Fondi) and
Itri, whence there is a view of Gaeta. The next place is Formiæ,
Mola di Gaeta, on the beautiful bay of Gaeta. There are numerous
remains about the site of Formiæ, which of course are taken for
Cicero’s villa. The site was doubtless near the Mola and the village
Castiglione. The Formian villa was destroyed when Cicero was banished,
but he received some compensation, and he rebuilt it.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_284_284"></a><a href="#FNanchor_284_284" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[284]</span></a> This Popilius was C. Popilius Lænas, a military tribune, whom
Cicero at the request of M. Cælius had once defended (Dion Cassius,
47. c. 11).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_285_285"></a><a href="#FNanchor_285_285" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[285]</span></a> Plutarch’s narrative leads us to suppose that Cicero saw that his
time was come and offered his neck to the murderers. Appian’s
narrative (<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 20) is that Lænas drew Cicero’s head out of
the litter and struck three blows before he severed it. He was so
awkward at the work that the operation was like sawing the neck off.
</p><p>
Cicero was murdered on the 7th of December, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 73, being nearly
sixty-four years of age.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_286_286"></a><a href="#FNanchor_286_286" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[286]</span></a> The same story is told by Appian, except that he mentions only
the right hand. The murderer received for his pains a large sum of
money, much more than was promised. It is hardly credible that
Antonius placed the head of Cicero on a tablet at a banquet (Appian,
<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 20). Though he hated Cicero and with good reason,
such a brutal act is not credible of him, nor is it consistent with the
story of the head being fixed on the Rostra; not to mention other
reasons against the story that might be urged. Dion Cassius (47. c. 8)
says that Fulvia, the wife of Antonius, pierced the tongue of Cicero
with one of the pins which women wore in their hair, and added other
insults. To make his story probable, he says that it was done before
the head was fixed on the Rostra.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_287_287"></a><a href="#FNanchor_287_287" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[287]</span></a> His name was Philogonus. The story about Philogonus is refuted

death is unknown. Cicero’s son had neither ambition nor ability.
All that is certainly known of him is that he loved eating and
drinking, for neither of which had his father any inclination. There
are two letters of the son to Tiro extant (Cicero, <i>Ad Diversos</i>, xvi.
21, 25).
</p><p>
The Life of Cicero is only a sketch of Cicero’s character, but a better
sketch than any modern writer has made. It does not affect to be a
history of the times, nor does it affect to estimate with any exactness
his literary merit. But there is not a single great defect in his moral
character that is not touched, nor a virtue that has not been signalized.
Those who would do justice to him and have not time to
examine for themselves, may trust Plutarch at least as safely as any
modern writer.
</p><p>
If in these notes I have occasionally expressed an unfavourable
opinion directly or indirectly, I have expressed none that I do not
believe true, and none for which abundant evidence cannot be produced,
even from Cicero’s own writings. It is a feeble and contemptible
criticism that would palliate or excuse that which admits not
of excuse. It is a spurious liberality that would gloss over the vices
and faults of men because they have had great virtues, and would
impute to those who tell the whole truth a malignant pleasure in
defaming and vilifying exalted merit. This assumed fair dealing and
magnanimity would deprive us of the most instructive lessons that
human life teaches—that all men have their weaknesses, their failings
and their vices, and that no intellectual greatness is a security against
them. “It is not absolutely railing against anything to proclaim its
defects, because they are in all things to be found, how beautiful or
how much to be coveted soever” (Montaigne). The failings of a great
man are more instructive than those of an obscure man. They exhibit
the weak points at which any man may be assailed, and in some of
which no man is impregnable. Cicero’s writings have made us as
familiar with him as with the writers of our own country, and there is
hardly a European author of modern times who is more universally
read than Cicero in some or other of his numerous compositions. His
letters alone, which were never intended for publication, and were
written to a great variety of persons as the events of the day prompted,
furnish a mass of historical evidence, which, if we consider his position
and the times in which he lived, is not surpassed by any similar collection.
He is thus mixed up with the events of the most stirring and
interesting period of his country’s history; and every person who
studies that history must endeavour to form a just estimate of the
character of a man who is both a great actor in public events and an
important witness.

The Life of Cicero by Middleton is a partial work: the evidence is
imperfectly examined and the author’s prejudices in favour of Cicero
have given a false colouring to many facts. The most laborious life of
Cicero is by Drumann (<i>Geschichte Roms</i>, Tullii), in which all the
authorities are collected. In the ‘Penny Cyclopædia’ (art. ‘Cicero’)
there is a good sketch of Cicero’s political career; and in the ‘Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology,’ edited by Dr. W.
Smith, a very complete account of Cicero’s writings, distributed under
their several heads.</p></div>

in debt himself and wished to be relieved. If he had lived in England,
he could easily have got relief. The story is told by Dion Cassius
(xlii. 29). The Romans <i>occasionally</i> proposed sweeping measures for
the settlement of accounts between debtor and creditor. A modern
nation has a permanent court for “the <i>relief</i> of insolvent debtors;” and
a few years ago a statute was passed in England (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 96),
which had the direct effect of cancelling all debts under 20<i>l.</i>; the
debtors for whose relief it was passed were well pleased, but the
creditors grumbled loudly, and it was amended. Those who blame
the Roman system of an occasional settlement of debts, should examine
the operation of a permanent law which has the same object; and they
will be assisted in comparing English and Roman morality on this
point by J.H. Elliott’s ‘Credit the Life of Commerce,’ London,

various things. Plutarch here gives a hint, which persons in high
places might find useful. Open flattery can only deceive a fool, and
it is seldom addressed to any but a fool, unless the flatterer himself be
so great a fool as not to know a wise man from a foolish: which is
sometimes the case. But there is flattery, as Plutarch intimates, which
addresses itself, not in the guise of flattery, but in the guise of truth,
one of the characters of which is plain speaking. It is hard for a man
in an exalted station to be always proof against flattery, for it is often
not easy to detect it. Nor in the intercourse of daily life is it always
easy to distinguish between him who gives you his honest advice and
opinion, and him who gives it merely to please you, or, what is often
worse, merely to please himself.</p></div>

her sick at Sikyon, and crossed from Corcyra (Corfu) to Italy. (Appian,

which he commenced the siege of the city. The war was stopped by
the reconciliation that is mentioned in the text, to which the news of

Sikyon without taking leave of her, and vexation and disease put an
end to her turbulent life. (Appian, <i>Civil Wars</i>, v. 59.)</p></div>

Antonius said he was well content with the match; and to show that
he was in earnest he demanded of them a contribution of one million
drachmæ as a portion with his new wife. He thus fleeced them of

In this passage Plutarch calls the Red Sea both the Arabian gulf

a gulf which runs into the land from the Erythræan sea; and this
gulf he calls (ii. 11, 158) the Arabian gulf, which is now the Red Sea.

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_479_479"></a><a href="#FNanchor_479_479" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[479]</span></a> The story of Dion (li. 14) is that Cæsar, after he had seen the body,
sent for the Psylli, serpent charmers, to suck out the poison (compare
Lucan, <i>Pharsal.</i> ix. 925). If a person was not dead, it was supposed
that the Psylli could extract the poison and save the life.
</p><p>
Dion Cassius also states that the true cause of Cleopatra’s death was
unknown. One account was that she punctured her arm with a hair-pin
(βελόνη) which was poisoned. But even as to the punctures on the arm,
Plutarch does not seem to state positively that there were any. The
“hollow comb” is hardly intelligible. Plutarch’s word is κνηστίς, “a
scraping instrument of any kind.” One MS. has κιστίς, “a small
coffer.” Strabo (p. 795, ed. Casaub.) doubts whether she perished by
the bite of a serpent or by puncturing herself with a poisoned instrument.
Propertius (iii. 11, 53) alludes to the image of Cleopatra, which
was carried in the triumph—
</p><p><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Et trahere occultum membra soporis iter.</span><br>
</p>
<p>
An ancient marble at Rome represents Cleopatra with the asp on her
arm. There was also a story of her applying it to the left breast.
</p><p>
Cleopatra was born in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 69, and died in the latter part of <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 30.
She was seventeen years of age when her father Ptolemæus Auletes
died: and upon his death she governed jointly with her brother
Ptolemæus, whose wife she was to be. Antonius first saw her when he
was in Egypt with Gabinius, and he had not forgotten the impression
which the young girl then made on him at the time when she visited
him at Tarsus (Appian, <i>Civil Wars</i>, v. 8). Antonius was forty
years old when he saw Cleopatra at Tarsus, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 41, and he would
therefore be in his fifty-second year at the time of his death (Clinton,
<i>Fasti</i>).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_480_480"></a><a href="#FNanchor_480_480" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[480]</span></a> Octavia’s care of the children of Antonius is one of the beautiful
traits of her character. She is one of those Roman women whose
virtues command admiration.
</p><p>
Cleopatra, the daughter of Antonius and twin sister of Alexander,
married Juba II., king of Numidia, by whom she had a son Ptolemæus,
who succeeded his father, and a daughter Drusilla, who married
Antonius Felix, the governor of Judæa. The two brothers of
Cleopatra were Alexander and Ptolemæus.
</p><p>
Antonius, the son of Fulvia, was called Iulus Antonius. He
married Marcella, one of the daughters of Octavia. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 10,
Antonius was consul. He formed an adulterous intercourse with
Julia, the daughter of Augustus, which cost him his life <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2.
Antonius was a poet, as it seems (Horat. <i>Carm.</i> iv. 2, and Orelli’s
note).
</p><p>
The elder Antonia, the daughter of Octavia and Antonius, married
L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, the son of Cneius, who deserted to Cæsar
just before the battle of Actium. This Lucius had by Antonia a son,
Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who married Agrippina, the daughter of
Cæsar Germanicus. Agrippina’s son, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was
adopted by the emperor Claudius after his marriage with Agrippina,
and Lucius then took the name of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus. As
the emperor Nero his infamy is imperishable.
</p><p>
The younger Antonia, the daughter of Octavia and Antonius,
married Drusus, the second son of Tiberius Claudius Nero. Tiberius
had divorced his wife Livia in order that Caesar Octavianus might
become her husband. The virtues of Antonia are recorded by
Plutarch and others: her beauty is testified by her handsome face on
a medal.
</p><p>
The expression of Plutarch that Caius, by whom he means Caius
Caligula, “ruled with distinction,” has caused the commentators some
difficulty, and they have proposed to read ἐπιμανῶς, “like a madman”
in place of ἐπιφανῶς, “with distinction.” Perhaps Plutarch’s meaning
may be something like what I have given, and he may allude to the
commencement of Caligula’s reign, which gave good hopes, as
Suetonius shows. Some would get over the difficulty by giving to
ἐπιφανῶς a different meaning from the common meaning. See Kaltwasser’s
note.
</p><p>
A portrait of Antonius (see Notes to Brutus, c. 52) would be an idle
impertinence. He is portrayed clear and distinct in this inimitable
Life of Plutarch.

it begins the Monarchy, as Plutarch would call it, or the sole rule of
Augustus. See the Preface to the First Volume.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_486_486"></a><a href="#FNanchor_486_486" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[486]</span></a> Grote paraphrases this passage as follows:—“A little squadron
was prepared, of no more than five merchantmen, two of them vessels
of thirty oars, &amp;c.” On consulting Liddell and Scott’s Lexicon, s.v.
τριακόντορος, I find a reference to Thuc. iv. 9; where a Messenian
pirate triaconter is spoken of, and for further information the reader
is referred to the article “πεντηκόντορος (sc. ναῦς), ἡ, a ship of burden
with fifty oars,” Pind. P. 4. 436, Eur. I.T. 1124, Thuc. i., 14, &amp;c. But
none of these passages bear out the sense of a “vessel of burden.” The
passage in Pindar merely states that the snake which Jason slew was
as big or bigger than a πεντηκόντορος. Herod, ii. 163, distinctly
says “not ships of burden, but penteconters.” In Eur. I.T. 1124, the
chorus merely remark that Iphigenia will be borne home by a penteconter,
while Thucydides (i. 14) explicitly states that, many generations
after the Trojan war, the chief navies of Greece consisted of
but few triremes, and chiefly of “penteconters or of long ships equipped
like them.” From these passages I am inclined to think that the true
meaning of the passage is the literal one, that the soldiers were placed
on board of two transports, that the two triaconters, or thirty-oared
galleys, were ships of war and acted as convoy to them, and that the
small vessel was intended for Dion and his friends to escape in if
necessary. In Dem. Zen. a πεντηκόντορος undoubtedly is spoken of
as a merchant vessel; but this does not prove that there were no war
penteconters in Dion’s time.</p></div>

that Herakleides brought only seven triremes. But the force stated
by Diodorus (twenty triremes, three transports and 1500 soldiers)
appears more probable. It is difficult otherwise to explain the number
of ships which the Syracusans presently appear as possessing. Moreover,
the great importance which Herakleides steps into, as opposed
to Dion, is more easily accounted for.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_494_494"></a><a href="#FNanchor_494_494" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[494]</span></a> The Syracusan cavalry was celebrated, and “the knights” here

and that Dion, sitting on one side of this room, saw the apparition
behind the columns on the other. An outside portico was a very
unusual appendage to a Greek house, and Dion’s house is said to have
been especially simple and unpretending, whereas nearly all houses
were built with an inner court or “patio,” with its roof supported by
columns, and into which the other rooms of the house opened.</p></div>

p. 37) gives a sketch of his literary activity. Such a trifle as an
epitome of Polybius was probably only intended as a mere occupation
to pass the time. The loss of it is not a matter of regret, any further
than so far as it might have supplied some deficiencies in the present
text of Polybius. Bacon (Advancement of Learning) describes epitomes
thus: “As for the corruptions and moths of history, which are
epitomes, the use of them deserveth to be banished, as all men of sound
judgment have confessed; as those that have fretted and corroded the
sound bodies of many excellent histories, and wrought them into base
and unprofitable dregs.”</p></div>

Cæsar in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 47. The Prætor Urbanus still held the first rank.
The motive of Cæsar may have been, as Dion Cassius says, to oblige

and Cassius (xv. 19) in reply defends them. Cicero says to Cassius,
that he hopes he will tell him whether it is in his power, as soon as he
chooses to think of Cassius, to have his spectrum (εἴδωλον) present,
before him, and whether, if he should begin to think of the island
Britannia, the image (spectrum) of Britannia will fly to his mind.

<p>The doctrine which Lucretius inculcated as to the deities, admitted
their existence, but denied that they concerned themselves about mundane
affairs; and they had nothing to do with the creation of the
world. It is one of the main purposes of the poem to free men from
all religious belief, and to show the misery and absurdities that it
breeds.</p>
<p>A belief in dæmons would be inconsistent with such doctrines; and
as to the gods, Cassius means to say, that though he did not believe in
their existence, he almost wished that there were gods to aid their
righteous cause.</p>
<p>As to the opinions of Cassius, compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 66.</p></div>

who had been sent forward with eight legions, and had occupied
Philippi. The town of Philippi lay near the mountain-range of
Pangæus and Symbolum, which was the name of a place at which
Pangæus joins another mountain, that stretches up into the interior.
Symbolum was between Neapolis (new city) and Philippi. Neapolis
was on the coast opposite to Thasus: Philippi was in the mountain
region, and was built on a hill; west of it was a plain which extended
to the Strymon (Appian, <i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 1205; Dion Cassius. xlvii. 35).
Philippi was originally called Krenides, or the Springs, then Datus,
and lastly Philippi by King Philippus, of Macedonia, who fortified it.
Appian’s description of the position of Philippi is very clear.</p></div>

Volumnius Eutrapelus, a boon companion of Antonius. Several of
Cicero’s letters to him are extant (<i>Ad Div.</i> vii. 32, 33).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_568_568"></a><a href="#FNanchor_568_568" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[568]</span></a> Plutarch has handled the character of Brutus with partiality.
He could not be ignorant of his love of money and of the oppressive
manner in which he treated his unlucky creditors. Drumann (<i>Junii</i>,
p. 20, &amp;c.) has collected the evidence on this point. Though Brutus
was an austere man and affected philosophy, his character is not free
from the imputation of ingratitude to Cæsar, love of power, and avarice.
He seems to have been one of those who deceive themselves into a
belief of their own virtues, because they are free from other people’s
vices. The promise of plunder to his soldiers is not excusable
because Antonius and Cæsar did worse than he intended to do.
Plutarch here alludes to many of the Italians being driven out of
their lands, which were given to the soldiers who had fought on the
side of Cæsar and Antonius at Philippi. The misery that was
occasioned by this measure was one of the chief evils of the Civil
Wars. The slaughter in war chiefly affected the soldiers themselves,
and if both armies had been destroyed, the people would only have
been the better for it. The misery that arose from the ejection of the
hard-working husbandmen reached to their wives and children. But
a country which had a large army on foot which is no longer wanted,
must either pay them out of taxes and plunder, or have a revolution.
Necessity was the excuse for Cæsar and Antonius, and the same
necessity would have been the excuse of Brutus, if he had been
victorious. Defeat saved him from this necessity.</p></div>

Is cursing her faithless husband Jason. The educated Romans were
familiar with the Greek dramatists, whom they often quoted. (Compare
the Life of Pompeius, c. 78.) Appian says that Brutus intended
to apply this line to Antonius (<i>Civil Wars</i>, iv. 130).
</p><p>
The other verse, which Volumnius forgot, was remembered by somebody
else, if it be the verse of which Florus (iv. 7) has recorded the
substance, “that virtue is not a reality, but a name.” Dion Cassius
(xlvii. 49, and the note of Reimarus) also has recorded two Greek
verses which Brutus is said to have uttered; but he does not mention
the verse which Plutarch cites. The substance of the two verses
cited by Dion is this:</p>

<div class="line i04">“Poor virtue, empty name, whom I have serv’d</div>

(ii. 72) says that he was in his thirty-seventh year, which is a mistake.
</p><p>
The character of Brutus requires a special notice. It is easy
enough to write a character of a man, but not easy to write a true one.
Michelet (<i>Histoire de la Revolution Française</i>, ii. 545), speaking of the
chief actors of the revolution in 1789. ’90, ’91, says: “We have rarely
given a judgment entire, indistinct, no <i>portrait</i> properly speaking; all,
almost all, are unjust; resulting from a mean which is taken between
this and that moment in a person’s life, between the good and the bad,
neutralising the one by the other, and making both false. We have
judged the acts, as they present themselves, day by day, hour by hour.
We have given a date to our judgments; and this has allowed us often
to praise men, whom at a later time we shall have to blame. Criticism,
forgetful and harsh, too often condemns beginnings which are laudable,
having in view the end which it knows, of which it has a view beforehand.
But we do not choose to know this end; whatever this man may do to-morrow,
we note for his advantage the good which he does to-day: the
end will come soon enough.” This is the true method of writing
history; this is the true method of judging men. Unfortunately we
cannot trace the career of many individuals with that particularity of
date and circumstance which would enable us to do justice. Plutarch
does not draw characters in the mass in the modern way: he gives us
both the good and the bad, in detail: but with little regard sometimes
to time and circumstance. He has treated Brutus with partiality: he
finds only one act in his life to condemn (chap. 46). The great condemnation
of Brutus is, that acting in the name of virtue, he did not know
what it was; that fighting for his country, he was fighting for a party;
his Roman republic was a republic of aristocrats; his people was a
fraction of the Roman citizens; he conceived no scheme for regenerating
a whole nation: he engaged in a death struggle in which we can
feel no sympathy. His name is an idle abused theme for rhetoric; and
his portrait must be drawn, ill or well, that the world may be disabused.
</p><p>
Drumann (<i>Geschichte Roms</i>, Junii, p. 34) has carefully collected the
acts of Brutus; and he has judged him severely, and, I think, truly.
</p><p>
Brutus had moderate abilities, with great industry and much learning:
he had no merit as a general, but he had the courage of a soldier,
he had the reputation of virtue, and he was free from many of the
vices of his contemporaries; he was sober and temperate. Of enlarged
political views he had none; there is not a sign of his being superior
in this respect to the mass of his contemporaries. When the Civil
War broke out, he joined Pompeius, though Pompeius had murdered
his father. If he gave up his private enmity, as Plutarch says, for
what he believed to be the better cause, the sacrifice was honourable:
if there were other motives, and I believe there were, his choice of his
party does him no credit. His conspiracy against Cæsar can only be
justified by those, if there are such, who think that a usurper ought to
be got rid of in any way. But if a man is to be murdered, one does
not expect those to take a part in the act who, after being enemies
have received favours from him, and professed to be friends. The
murderers should at least be a man’s declared enemies who have just
wrongs to avenge. Though Brutus was dissatisfied with things
under Cæsar, he was not the first mover in the conspiracy. He was
worked upon by others, who knew that his character and personal
relation to Cæsar would in a measure sanctify the deed; and by their
persuasion, not his own resolve, he became an assassin in the name of
freedom, which meant the triumph of his party, and in the name of
virtue, which meant nothing.
</p><p>
The act was bad in Brutus as an act of treachery; and it was bad
as an act of policy. It failed in its object—the success of a party,
because the death of Cæsar was not enough; other victims were
necessary, and Brutus would not have them. He put himself at the
head of a plot, in which there was no plan: he dreamed of success and
forgot the means. He mistook the circumstances of the times and the
character of the men. His conduct after the murder was feeble and
uncertain; and it was also as illegal as the usurpation of Cæsar.
“He left Rome as prætor without the permission of the Senate; he
took possession of a province which, even according to Cicero’s
testimony, had been assigned to another; he arbitrarily passed
beyond the boundaries of his province, and set his effigy on the coins.”
(Drumann.) He attacked the Bessi in order to give his soldiers
booty, and he plundered Asia to get money for the conflict against
Cæsar and Antonius, for the mastery of Rome and Italy. The means
that he had at his disposal show that he robbed without measure and
without mercy; and never was greater tyranny exercised over helpless
people in the name of liberty than the wretched inhabitants of Asia
experienced from Brutus the “Liberator” and Cassius “the last of the
Romans.” But all these great resources were thrown away in an ill-conceived
and worse executed campaign.
</p><p>
Temperance, industry, and unwillingness to shed blood are noble
qualities in a citizen and a soldier; and Brutus possessed them. But
great wealth gotten by ill means is an eternal reproach; and the
trade of money-lending, carried on in the names of others, with unrelenting
greediness, is both avarice and hypocrisy. Cicero, the friend
of Brutus, is the witness for his wealth, and for his unworthy means to
increase it.
</p><p>
Reflecting men in all ages have a philosophy. With the educated
Greeks and Romans, philosophy was religion. The vulgar belief,
under whatever name it may be, is never the belief of those who have
leisure for reflection. The vulgar rich and vulgar poor are immersed in
sense: the man of reflection strives to emerge from it. To him the
things which are seen are only the shadows of the unseen; forms without
substance, but the evidence of the substantial: “for the invisible
things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made” (Epistle to the Romans, i.
20). Brutus was from his youth up a student of philosophy and well
versed in the systems of the Greeks. Untiring industry and a strong
memory had stored his mind with the thoughts of others, but he had
not capacity enough to draw profit from his intellectual as he did from
his golden treasures. His mind was a barren field on which no culture
could raise an abundant crop. His wisdom was the thoughts of others,
and he had ever ready in his mouth something that others had said. But
to utter other men’s wisdom is not enough: a man must make it his own
by the labour of independent thought. Philosophy and superstition
were blended in his mind, and they formed a chaos in his bewildered
brain, as they always will do; and the product is Gorgons and Hydras
and Chimeras dire. In the still of night phantoms floated before his
wasted strength and wakeful eyes; perhaps the vision of him, the
generous and the brave, who had saved the life of an enemy in battle,
and fell by his hand in the midst of peace. Conscience was his tormentor,
for truth was stronger than the illusions of self-imputed virtue.
Though Brutus had condemned Cato’s death, he died by his own hand,
not with the stubborn resolve of Cato, who would not yield to a usurper,
but merely to escape from his enemies. A Roman might be pardoned
for not choosing to become the prisoner of a Roman, but his
grave should have been the battlefield, and the instrument should
have been the hands of those who were fighting against the cause which
he proclaimed to be righteous and just. Cato’s son bettered his father’s
example: he died on the plain of Philippi by the sword of the enemy.
Brutus died without belief in the existence of that virtue which he
had affected to follow: the triumph of a wrongful cause, as he conceived
it, was a proof that virtue was an empty name. He forgot the
transitory nature of all individual existences, and thought that justice
perished with him. But a true philosopher does not make himself a
central point, nor his own misfortunes a final catastrophe. He looks both
backwards and forwards, to the past and the future, and views himself
as a small link in the great chain of events which holds all things
together. Brutus died in despair, with the courage, but not with the
faith, of a martyr.
</p><p>
When men talk of tyranny and rise against it, the name of Brutus
is invoked; a mere name and nothing else. What single act is there
in the man’s life which promised the regeneration of his country and
the freedom of mankind? Like other Romans, he only thought of
maintaining the supremacy of Rome; his ideas were no larger than
theirs; he had no sympathy for those whom Rome governed and oppressed.
For his country, he had nothing to propose; its worn-out
political constitution he would maintain, not amend; indeed, amendment
was impossible. Probably he dreaded anarchy and the dissolution
of social order, for that would have released his creditors and
confiscated his valuable estates. But Cæsar’s usurpation was not an
anarchy: it was a monarchy, a sole rule; and Brutus, who was ambitious,
could not endure that. It may be said that if the political
views of Brutus were narrow, he was only like most of his countrymen.
But why then is he exalted, and why is his name invoked? What
single title had he to distinction except what Cæsar gave him? A man
of unknown family, the son of a woman whom Cæsar had debauched,
pardoned after fighting against his mother’s lover, raised by him to the
prætorship, and honoured with Cæsar’s friendship—he has owed his distinction
to nothing else than murdering the man whose genius he could
not appreciate, but whose favours he had enjoyed.
</p><p>
His spurious philosophy has helped to save him from the detestation
which is his due; but the false garb should be stripped off. A stoic,
an ascetic, and nothing more, is a mere negation. The active virtues
of Brutus are not recorded. If he sometimes did an act of public
justice (c. 35), it was not more than many other Romans have done. To
reduce this philosopher to his true level, we ask, what did he say or do
that showed a sympathy with all mankind? Where is the evidence
that he had the feeling of justice which alone can regenerate a nation?
But it may be said, why seek in a Roman of his age what we cannot
expect to find? Why then elevate him above the rest of his age and
consecrate his name? Why make a hero of him who murdered his
benefactor, and then ran away from the city which he was to save—from
we know not what? And why make a virtuous man of him who
was only austere, and who did not believe in the virtues that he professed?
As to statesmanship, nobody has claimed that for him yet.
</p><p>
“The deputy of Arras, poor, and despised even by his own party, won
the confidence of the people by their belief in his probity: and he deserved
it. Fanatical and narrow-minded, he was still a man of principles.
Untiring industry, unshaken faith, and poverty, the guarantee
of his probity, raised him slowly to distinction, and enabled him to
destroy all who stood between him and the realisation of an unbending
theory. Though he had sacrificed the lives of others, he scorned to
save his own by doing what would have contradicted his principles: he
respected the form of legality, when its substance no longer existed,
and refused to sanction force when it would have been used for his
own protection” (Lamartine, <i>Histoire des Girondins</i>, liv. 61, ix.). A
great and memorable example of crime, of fanaticism, and of virtue;
of a career commenced in the cause of justice, in truth, faith and sincerity;
of a man who did believe in virtue, and yet spoiled the cause
in which he embarked, and left behind him a name for universal
execration.
</p><p>
Treachery at home, enmity abroad, and misconduct in its own
leaders, made the French Revolution result in anarchy, and then in a
tyranny. The Civil Wars of Rome resulted in a monarchy, and there
was nothing else in which they could end. The Roman monarchy or
the Empire was a natural birth. The French Empire was an abortion.
The Roman Empire was the proper growth of the ages that had preceded
it: they could produce nothing better. In a few years after the
battle of Philippi, Cæsar Octavianus got rid of his partner Antonius;
and under the administration of Augustus the world enjoyed comparative
peace, and the Roman Empire was established and consolidated.
The genius of Augustus, often ill appreciated, is demonstrated by the
results of his policy. He restored order to a distracted state and
transmitted his power to his successors. The huge fabric of Roman
greatness resting on its ancient foundations, only crumbled beneath
the assaults that time and new circumstances make against all political
institutions.</p></div>

speedily revealed to him, and though the forces of the Gaulish
province were disposed to follow their chief, the more powerful legions
of Lower Germany, under Virginius Rufus, were in full march against
them. The armies met at Vesontio, and there Virginius and Vindex
at a private interview agreed to conspire together, but their troops
could come to no such understanding; the Virginians attacked the
soldiers of Vindex, and almost cut them to pieces. Vindex thereupon,
with the haste and levity of his race, threw himself upon his sword,
and the rebellion seemed for a moment to be crushed. Merivale’s

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
